Friday of last week, June 24th, 2022, was a profoundly dark day for a great many of us in the United States. Feeling somewhat helpless as the Supreme Court published the final draft of Dobbs v. Jackson Women&amp;rsquo;s Health Organization, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but fall back on old patterns. Not really knowing what else to do—I had a student with whom I had recently read the leaked original draft posted by Politico—I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but say to her when the opinion came down that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what else to do other than to get to reading.</description></item><item><title>Linear Regression in the Humanities(?!?!) ... not quite</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-06-01-linear-regression-in-the-humanities/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-06-01-linear-regression-in-the-humanities/</guid><description>Working my way through some of the new lessons from Codecademy&amp;rsquo;s new &amp;ldquo;Data Scientist: Natural Language Processing Specialist&amp;rdquo; path, I was returning to some of the lessons on linear regression usage in machine learning contexts. I also happened across a really fantastic post from the &amp;ldquo;LaTeX Ninja&amp;rdquo; on &amp;ldquo;Machine Learning for the Humanities: A Very Short Introduction&amp;rdquo;—I hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet come across this site yet and find it full of all kinds of fantastic little nuggets.</description></item><item><title>Fetching Data from a TOML File into a HUGO Table</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-05-29-toml-data-to-hugo-table/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 17:51:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-05-29-toml-data-to-hugo-table/</guid><description>Continuing to learn the whole HUGO ecosystem here, I figured I would try a little testing of some things. What if I had a bunch of data in a simple .json or .toml or .yaml or whatever file and wanted to pull/fetch data from that file into one of my posts? I did have some data from the last post about Henry James&amp;rsquo;s use of certain words that we used to generate some of the graphs.</description></item><item><title>More _The Turn of the Screw_ Data Analysis</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-05-27-henry-james-turn-of-the-screw-data-analysis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2022 11:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-05-27-henry-james-turn-of-the-screw-data-analysis/</guid><description>I know I mentioned in an earlier post—a couple of different posts actually (here and here too)—that I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a bunch of work with Henry James&amp;rsquo;s canonical The Turn of the Screw. I thought I would post a little bit more here of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to as of late with this. A student of mine was fascinated by the use of the words &amp;ldquo;prodigious&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;portentous&amp;rdquo; in the Governess&amp;rsquo;s narrative in Turn.</description></item><item><title>Let's Do Some Real World HTML Table Parsing with Beautiful Soup</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-05-25-real-world-beautiful-soup-html-table-parsing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 00:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-05-25-real-world-beautiful-soup-html-table-parsing/</guid><description>Given that I&amp;rsquo;m continuing to chronicle my DH journeys here, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d showcase a little bit of my utilization of scraping data from a website with Beautiful Soup (docs are here).
Doing some research for a favorite student of mine, I&amp;rsquo;ve been wandering around websites devoted to law school.

Somehow—not exactly sure how—I managed to forget how incredibly rich this text is and this is not even to mention the rich secondary criticism produced by this short little novella.

His video laying out the steps for a &amp;ldquo;Binary Data Classification&amp;rdquo; was clear and quite clarifying for me in all kinds of ways. The classifier&amp;rsquo;s job in this video was to see if it could tell the difference between the work of Oscar Wilde and Dan Brown.

A while back I worked my way through Folgert Karsdorp, Mike Kestemont, and Allen Riddell&amp;rsquo;s Humanities Data Analysis: Case Studies with Python. I found a great deal of it thought-provoking and fascinating—especially the chapters devoted to modeling texts with vector spaces and the later chapter on stylometry, which focused on some texts by Hildegard of Bingen and Bernard of Clairvaux.</description></item><item><title>Viral Tweet Classification Project</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-03-26-twitter-viral-tweet-classification-project/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-03-26-twitter-viral-tweet-classification-project/</guid><description>I had a bit of fun recently working on a machine learning classification project using some Twitter data (said project coming through Codecademy). The goal was to see if we could write some code to properly detect whether or not a tweet was viral (using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm). I also played around with a logistic regression model as well.

As Department Chair, a good deal of the Assessment Reports each year fall to me. Historically, for the past couple of years I have been more than content to simply just keep all of the scores on our assessed outcomes in one gigantic Excel spreadsheet.</description></item><item><title>Playing with Plain Text and CSS Templates</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2021-12-27-playing-with-plain-text-and-css-templates_05/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Dec 2021 12:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2021-12-27-playing-with-plain-text-and-css-templates_05/</guid><description>Over the past few months I have been thinking a great deal about how to incorporate all this new knowledge about digital methodology, data science, data analytics, (scholarly and non-scholarly) work/writing in the &amp;ldquo;digital&amp;rdquo; era into the way I do things as a scholar, teacher, thinker, etc. One of the key people that has been really informative for me has been Jonathan Reeve over at Columbia University. One of his posts from earlier this year, &amp;ldquo;Rethinking the MLA Style Research Paper&amp;rdquo; was incredibly generative for me—and it nicely dovetailed with some work my Departmental colleagues have been doing on thinking about writing at our university (a project generously funded by the Arthur Vining Davis Foundation).</description></item><item><title>Visualizing Online Class Discussion Boards</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2019-12-31-visualizing-online-class-discussion-boards_04/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 12:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2019-12-31-visualizing-online-class-discussion-boards_04/</guid><description>A Fantastic Anthology
So, this last semester I did another &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Literature&amp;rdquo; course (as I so often do)—this time around I decided to set the theme around that of &amp;ldquo;weird fiction.&amp;rdquo; Since the South Bend DHRI last May I have been thinking a great deal about this whole &amp;ldquo;data visualization&amp;rdquo; thing.
