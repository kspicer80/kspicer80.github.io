Somehow—not exactly sure how—I managed to forget how incredibly rich this text is and this is not even to mention the rich secondary criticism produced by this short little novella. Inspired—once again—by some posts from Jonathan Reeve over at Columbia (specifically, his nice write-up about sentence lengths in James along with his encoded .</description></item><item><title>Binary Text Classification Fun! ... with some Literary Texts by Willa Cather and Sarah Orne Jewett</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-04-10-classification-fun-with-some-literary-texts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-04-10-classification-fun-with-some-literary-texts/</guid><description>In my DH journey, the work of Dr. William Mattingly has been something of a constant companion and guide.
His video laying out the steps for a &amp;ldquo;Binary Data Classification&amp;rdquo; was clear and quite clarifying for me in all kinds of ways. The classifier&amp;rsquo;s job in this video was to see if it could tell the difference between the work of Oscar Wilde and Dan Brown. What if we tried a different pair of authors/texts?</description></item><item><title>Using Vector Space Models with Shakespeare's Plays</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-03-29-vector-space-models-and-shakespeare/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-03-29-vector-space-models-and-shakespeare/</guid><description>Much of the toe-dipping into this new DH field I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing as of late has centered around learning many of the kinds of projects carried out and then turning the methods within those projects onto mew artifacts. A while back I worked my way through Folgert Karsdorp, Mike Kestemont, and Allen Riddell&amp;rsquo;s Humanities Data Analysis: Case Studies with Python. I found a great deal of it thought-provoking and fascinating—especially the chapters devoted to modeling texts with vector spaces and the later chapter on stylometry, which focused on some texts by Hildegard of Bingen and Bernard of Clairvaux.</description></item><item><title>Viral Tweet Classification Project</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-03-26-twitter-viral-tweet-classification-project/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-03-26-twitter-viral-tweet-classification-project/</guid><description>I had a bit of fun recently working on a machine learning classification project using some Twitter data (said project coming through Codecademy). The goal was to see if we could write some code to properly detect whether or not a tweet was viral (using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm). I also played around with a logistic regression model as well. All the code for the following is available in this repo.</description></item><item><title>Sentiment Analysis of Some Chicagoland Universities' Main Twitter Accounts</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-02-15-twitter-sentiment-analysis_07/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 12:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-02-15-twitter-sentiment-analysis_07/</guid><description>Well, February has come around and that&amp;rsquo;s the time at my school where we get all kinds of nice financial data about how wages and compensation by faculty rank compare between a number of &amp;ldquo;peer institutions&amp;rdquo; (the usual ones linked with USF here in Chicagoland are Benedictine, Dominican, Lewis, and Saint Xavier) I wondered a bit if one might do a little bit of data visualization not of financial information, but of, say, Twitter accounts.</description></item><item><title>Letting Excel Go and Departmental Assessment Reports</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-01-18-letting-excel-go_06/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 08:19:43 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-01-18-letting-excel-go_06/</guid><description>For those that work in disciplines that are much closer to STEM fields than me over here in philosophy and literature, I have no doubt that most of what I want to showcase here will no doubt be the height of banality. As Department Chair, a good deal of the Assessment Reports each year fall to me. Historically, for the past couple of years I have been more than content to simply just keep all of the scores on our assessed outcomes in one gigantic Excel spreadsheet.</description></item><item><title>Playing with Plain Text and CSS Templates</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2021-12-27-playing-with-plain-text-and-css-templates_05/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Dec 2021 12:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2021-12-27-playing-with-plain-text-and-css-templates_05/</guid><description>Over the past few months I have been thinking a great deal about how to incorporate all this new knowledge about digital methodology, data science, data analytics, (scholarly and non-scholarly) work/writing in the &amp;ldquo;digital&amp;rdquo; era into the way I do things as a scholar, teacher, thinker, etc. One of the key people that has been really informative for me has been Jonathan Reeve over at Columbia University. One of his posts from earlier this year, &amp;ldquo;Rethinking the MLA Style Research Paper&amp;rdquo; was incredibly generative for me—and it nicely dovetailed with some work my Departmental colleagues have been doing on thinking about writing at our university (a project generously funded by the Arthur Vining Davis Foundation).</description></item><item><title>Visualizing Online Class Discussion Boards</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2019-12-31-visualizing-online-class-discussion-boards_04/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 12:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2019-12-31-visualizing-online-class-discussion-boards_04/</guid><description>A Fantastic Anthology
So, this last semester I did another &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Literature&amp;rdquo; course (as I so often do)—this time around I decided to set the theme around that of &amp;ldquo;weird fiction.&amp;rdquo; Since the South Bend DHRI last May I have been thinking a great deal about this whole &amp;ldquo;data visualization&amp;rdquo; thing. I wanted to find some way to visually represent the stories in the anthology that students were gravitating to from week to week.</description></item><item><title>Still Playing Around with Python, NLTK, spaCy, etc.</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2019-12-24-still-playing-around-with-python-nltk-spacy-etc_03/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2019 12:05:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2019-12-24-still-playing-around-with-python-nltk-spacy-etc_03/</guid><description>Ugh, so clearly my discipline in posting is nonexistent.

This past July I got an opportunity to do a NEH Summer Seminar over at the University of Iowa (&amp;quot;Religion, Secularism, and the Novel&amp;quot;), where the group read a number of canonical novels (Crusoe, Silas Marner, Dracula, On the Road, and Home).</description></item><item><title>More (Initial) Digital Humanities Stuff</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2019-07-06-more-initial-digital-humanities-stuff_02/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2019 12:05:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2019-07-06-more-initial-digital-humanities-stuff_02/</guid><description>I am totally not under the impression that any of these initial thoughts on my inchoate exploration of the DH field (a field whose history I am only now beginning to really grasp) will be of any use whatsoever. I am just beginning to dip my toes into water that others are already expert swimmers in—and have been for many many years. I am not sure either if the kinds of things these digital or computational tools can do will be all they helpful to me in the long run.</description></item><item><title>Inaugural Post and ...
