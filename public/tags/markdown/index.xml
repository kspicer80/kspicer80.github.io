      <description>In my previous post I mentioned off-handedly the task of updating the dates on my syllabi as I transition from the Fall to the Spring to the Summer semesters. I figured I would post some of the code to help out with this tiny little mini-project. (All the code for this is available in the following repository.)
I have a pretty simple Canvas main page that has all the dates, readings, and assignments laid out in a simple little table—all on one main page:</description>

      <description>So, like so many (here and here as nice and simple examples—heck, even Graham Harman has gotten into the discussion here) in the computer science field, I have been playing around with the newly-released &amp;ldquo;ChatGPT&amp;rdquo; chatbot released through openAI. It&amp;rsquo;s also that time of the year when we academics start turning to getting all of those syllabi for the upcoming Spring semester ready to go. We all now how onerous it can be to create, say, a reading schedule with dates that we always need to shift when we move from one semester to another.</description>

      <description>For those that work in disciplines that are much closer to STEM fields than me over here in philosophy and literature, I have no doubt that most of what I want to showcase here will no doubt be the height of banality. As Department Chair, a good deal of the Assessment Reports each year fall to me. Historically, for the past couple of years I have been more than content to simply just keep all of the scores on our assessed outcomes in one gigantic Excel spreadsheet.</description>

      <description>Over the past few months I have been thinking a great deal about how to incorporate all this new knowledge about digital methodology, data science, data analytics, (scholarly and non-scholarly) work/writing in the &amp;ldquo;digital&amp;rdquo; era into the way I do things as a scholar, teacher, thinker, etc. One of the key people that has been really informative for me has been Jonathan Reeve over at Columbia University. One of his posts from earlier this year, &amp;ldquo;Rethinking the MLA Style Research Paper&amp;rdquo; was incredibly generative for me—and it nicely dovetailed with some work my Departmental colleagues have been doing on thinking about writing at our university (a project generously funded by the Arthur Vining Davis Foundation).</description>
