I found a dataset on Kaggle Datasets that had data from the very start of the NBA up until today.
So, we filtered out all the regular season game and then plotted the data. We have the raw blowout data in the first image and then the proportions in the second plot below:</description></item><item><title>As Promised---Skubal and Skenes Career K Projections</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2025-06-19-skubal_vs_skenes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 17:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2025-06-19-skubal_vs_skenes/</guid><description>As in my previous post I promised to look at both Skenes and Skubal and their projected trajectories towards 3000 career strikeouts. If we&amp;rsquo;re being honest, this benchmark is far from easy to achieve, only 19 pitchers in the history of baseball have done it before:
Pitcher Strikeouts Nolan Ryan 5,714 Randy Johnson 4,875 Roger Clemens 4,672 Steve Carlton 4,136 Bert Blyleven 3,701 Tom Seaver 3,640 Don Sutton 3,574 Gaylord Perry 3,534 Walter Johnson 3,509 Greg Maddux 3,371 Phil Niekro 3,342 Ferguson Jenkins 3,192 Pedro Martinez 3,154 Bob Gibson 3,117 Curt Schilling 3,116 CC Sabathia 3,093 John Smoltz 3,084 Justin Verlander 3,041 Max Scherzer 3,000 (IIRC, CC Sabathia and Justin Verlander are also on this list too.</description></item><item><title>More MLB Visualizations ... For a Larf</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2025-06-17-skubal-k-projections/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 13:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2025-06-17-skubal-k-projections/</guid><description>With Tarik Skubal on the mound tomorrow&amp;mdash;Wednesday, June 18&amp;mdash;for the Tigers against Pittsburgh, considered by many to be the best pitcher in baseball, I thought we could take a look at Skubal&amp;rsquo;s projections real quick as a larf. I figured we could use the code from our previous blog post looking at Paul Skenes and Clayton Kershaw and see what we can see; just a couple changes to the player we&amp;rsquo;re looking at and weâ€™re good to go:</description></item><item><title>We've Done Some NBA and WNBA Data Analysis ...

Having earlier watched Pittsburgh Pirates ace Paul Skenes go, I wonder if we could visualize the possibilities of the latter eventually clearing that line.
We can project Paul Skenes&amp;rsquo;s trajectory based on some estimates&amp;mdash;whether we&amp;rsquo;re really optimistic in certain K numbers per game or pessimistic&amp;mdash;and we get something like this:</description></item><item><title>WNBA Historical Stats</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2025-05-24-wnba-historical-stats/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2025-05-24-wnba-historical-stats/</guid><description>Yay! The WNBA season is upon us and already started! Since I had recently done some analysis on the NBA Playoffs&amp;mdash;I figured I would goof around and play with the WNBA a little bit. In service of that, let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.
So, as always, we start with data gathering. I tried using the fabulous nba_api to grab data, but for years closer to the creation of the league (1997), things seemed a little spotty to me.</description></item><item><title>NBA Playoff Blowouts</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2025-05-24-nba-playoff-blowouts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 13:01:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2025-05-24-nba-playoff-blowouts/</guid><description>Watching the 2025 NBA Playoffs has been a bit strange: huge blowouts (sometimes, often, unexpected) follow by razor-tight contests that go down to the very last possession or even into overtime.
After the Denver Nuggets&amp;rsquo; exit from the playoffs at the hands of the OKC Thunder, Aaron Gordon of the Nuggets has a rather intriguing post-game press conference where he himself mentioned the &amp;ldquo;blowouts&amp;rdquo; thing (thus making it not something just in my head, I suppose).</description></item></channel></rss>
