I figured we could use the code from our previous blog post looking at Paul Skenes and Clatyton Kershaw and see what we can see; just a couple changes to the player we&amp;rsquo;re looking at and weâ€™re good to go:</description></item><item><title>We've Done Some NBA and WNBA Data Analysis ...

Having earlier watched Pittsburgh Pirates ace Paul Skenes go, I wonder if we could visualize the possibilities of the latter eventually clearing that line.
We can project Paul Skenes&amp;rsquo;s trajectory based on some estimates&amp;mdash;whether we&amp;rsquo;re really optimistic in certain K numbers per game or pessimistic&amp;mdash;and we get something like this:</description></item><item><title>WNBA Historical Stats</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2025-05-24-wnba-historical-stats/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2025-05-24-wnba-historical-stats/</guid><description>Yay! The WNBA season is upon us and already started! Since I had recently done some analysis on the NBA Playoffs&amp;mdash;I figured I would goof around and play with the WNBA a little bit. In service of that, let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.
So, as always, we start with data gathering. I tried using the fabulous nba_api to grab data, but for years closer to the creation of the league (1997), things seemed a little spotty to me.</description></item><item><title>NBA Playoff Blowouts</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2025-05-24-nba-playoff-blowouts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 13:01:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2025-05-24-nba-playoff-blowouts/</guid><description>Watching the 2025 NBA Playoffs has been a bit strange: huge blowouts (sometimes, often, unexpected) follow by razor-tight contests that go down to the very last possession or even into overtime.
After the Denver Nuggets&amp;rsquo; exit from the playoffs at the hands of the OKC Thunder, Aaron Gordon of the Nuggets has a rather intriguing post-game press conference where he himself mentioned the &amp;ldquo;blowouts&amp;rdquo; thing (thus making it not something just in my head, I suppose).</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin vs. the DOW and NASDAQ</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2025-01-06-cryptos-vs-dow-jones-and-nasdaq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 00:10:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2025-01-06-cryptos-vs-dow-jones-and-nasdaq/</guid><description>So there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of talk lately about Microstrategy&amp;rsquo;s seemingly almost constant buys of Bitcoin almost every single day. There&amp;rsquo;s also been quite a lot of chatter recently about some other hardware companies, (Marvel Technologies, MARA, etc.) getting involved. We also have things like &amp;ldquo;Coinbase&amp;rdquo; that is frequently linked to Bitcoin as well.
I thought I would do some coding to see how correlated these stock tickers are with Bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Building a Dash App to Visualize the 5, 13, 8 EMA Investment Strategy</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2024-12-14-building_a_dash_app_to_visualize_investment_strategy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:10:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2024-12-14-building_a_dash_app_to_visualize_investment_strategy/</guid><description>So, continuing to goof-around a little bit with applying my Python knowledge to analysis of the stock markets, I decided to build a Dash app with Plotly that would allow one to see real-time price action while also implementing the well-known &amp;ldquo;5-13-8 EMA&amp;rdquo; trading strategy.
It&amp;rsquo;s still a work-in-progress to be sure &amp;hellip; and it&amp;rsquo;s probably totally unnecessary&amp;mdash;such indicators and plots are quickly and easily used on platforms like Trading View and Ninja Trader, but I wondered if I could do myself, from scratch.</description></item><item><title>Economic Analyses: High-Yield Savings Accounts (HYSA) and Bitcoin ... Given Posible Reduction in the Interest Rate by the FED</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2024-12-12-hysa-versus-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 00:10:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2024-12-12-hysa-versus-bitcoin/</guid><description>Okay, so recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been moving into using my Python knowledge to look at and analyze financial data. We know that the FED is next scheduled to meet on December 17-18 of this year. Many are predicting that we will see a decrease in interest rates.
So, if you have your money in a High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA)&amp;mdash;which you obviously should&amp;mdash;would it make more sense to move it elsewhere &amp;hellip; say, into Crypto?</description></item><item><title>Total *non sequitur*: Tracking the Price of Silver</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2024-08-30-tracking-silver-prices/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2024 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2024-08-30-tracking-silver-prices/</guid><description>Silver Price Tracker So, my father has some vintage Silver pieces from 1973 and 1974 produced by the Franklin Mint with all kinds of different national banks on each one. We&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to figure out how to unload them&amp;mdash;either to collectors or to folks that will simply melt them down for the silver alone. I figured I&amp;rsquo;d do a little coding.
The first is a plot over the last couple of months of Silver prices:</description></item></channel></rss>
