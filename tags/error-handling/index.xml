There was a wonderful little project—&amp;ldquo;ATM Logging&amp;rdquo;—that was quite fun to tackle, especially as it made really clear why one might want to use logging instead of filling one&amp;rsquo;s code with a bunch of print() statements. The setup was that we had a pretty simple little &amp;ldquo;ATM&amp;rdquo; program/script that would allow us to deposit and withdraw money—while providing some error messages to keep track of things throughout the whole process.</description></item></channel></rss>
