If we&amp;rsquo;re being honest, this benchmark is far from easy to achieve, only 19 pitchers in the history of baseball have done it before:
Pitcher Strikeouts Nolan Ryan 5,714 Randy Johnson 4,875 Roger Clemens 4,672 Steve Carlton 4,136 Bert Blyleven 3,701 Tom Seaver 3,640 Don Sutton 3,574 Gaylord Perry 3,534 Walter Johnson 3,509 Greg Maddux 3,371 Phil Niekro 3,342 Ferguson Jenkins 3,192 Pedro Martinez 3,154 Bob Gibson 3,117 Curt Schilling 3,116 CC Sabathia 3,093 John Smoltz 3,084 Justin Verlander 3,041 Max Scherzer 3,000 (IIRC, CC Sabathia and Justin Verlander are also on this list too.</description></item><item><title>More MLB Visualizations ...

I figured we could use the code from our previous blog post looking at Paul Skenes and Clayton Kershaw and see what we can see; just a couple changes to the player we&amp;rsquo;re looking at and we’re good to go:</description></item><item><title>Automating Syllabus Updating</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-12-19-syllabus-maker-stuff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2022 00:13:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-12-19-syllabus-maker-stuff/</guid><description>In my previous post I mentioned off-handedly the task of updating the dates on my syllabi as I transition from the Fall to the Spring to the Summer semesters. I figured I would post some of the code to help out with this tiny little mini-project. (All the code for this is available in the following repository.)
