I was also thinking about my initial MLB post (where we were looking at Skenes and Kershaw). I can imagine a reader wondering how we determined what an &amp;ldquo;optimistic&amp;rdquo; versus &amp;ldquo;pessimistic&amp;rdquo; trajectory for Skenes ultimately is &amp;hellip; I figured I would answer that in my writeup here of our Skenes vs. Skubal&amp;rsquo;s career K potential/trajectory. So let&amp;rsquo;s go producing a similar side-by-side comparison for these two but with the initial steps not being left out/omitted.</description></item><item><title>More MLB Visualizations ...

I figured we could use the code from our previous blog post looking at Paul Skenes and Clayton Kershaw and see what we can see; just a couple changes to the player we&amp;rsquo;re looking at and we’re good to go:</description></item><item><title>Automating Syllabus Updating</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-12-19-syllabus-maker-stuff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2022 00:13:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-12-19-syllabus-maker-stuff/</guid><description>In my previous post I mentioned off-handedly the task of updating the dates on my syllabi as I transition from the Fall to the Spring to the Summer semesters. I figured I would post some of the code to help out with this tiny little mini-project. (All the code for this is available in the following repository.)
I have a pretty simple Canvas main page that has all the dates, readings, and assignments laid out in a simple little table—all on one main page:</description></item></channel></rss>
