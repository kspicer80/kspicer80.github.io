There&amp;rsquo;s also been quite a lot of chatter recently about some other hardware companies, (Marvel Technologies, MARA, etc.) getting involved. We also have things like &amp;ldquo;Coinbase&amp;rdquo; that is frequently linked to Bitcoin as well.
I thought I would do some coding to see how correlated these stock tickers are with Bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Building a Dash App to Visualize the 5, 13, 8 EMA Investment Strategy</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2024-12-14-building_a_dash_app_to_visualize_investment_strategy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:10:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2024-12-14-building_a_dash_app_to_visualize_investment_strategy/</guid><description>So, continuing to goof-around a little bit with applying my Python knowledge to analysis of the stock markets, I decided to build a Dash app with Plotly that would allow one to see real-time price action while also implementing the well-known &amp;ldquo;5-13-8 EMA&amp;rdquo; trading strategy.
It&amp;rsquo;s still a work-in-progress to be sure &amp;hellip; and it&amp;rsquo;s probably totally unnecessary&amp;mdash;such indicators and plots are quickly and easily used on platforms like Trading View and Ninja Trader, but I wondered if I could do myself, from scratch.</description></item><item><title>Economic Analyses: High-Yield Savings Accounts (HYSA) and Bitcoin ... Given Posible Reduction in the Interest Rate by the FED</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2024-12-12-hysa-versus-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 00:10:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2024-12-12-hysa-versus-bitcoin/</guid><description>Okay, so recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been moving into using my Python knowledge to look at and analyze financial data. We know that the FED is next scheduled to meet on December 17-18 of this year. Many are predicting that we will see a decrease in interest rates.
So, if you have your money in a High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA)&amp;mdash;which you obviously should&amp;mdash;would it make more sense to move it elsewhere &amp;hellip; say, into Crypto?</description></item><item><title>Interacting with the Canvas Live API</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2023-01-13-canvas-live-api-work/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 00:06:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2023-01-13-canvas-live-api-work/</guid><description>In a previous post (&amp;ldquo;Automating Canvas Discussion Board Grading and Feedback&amp;rdquo;), I recounted some of the ways I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the CanvasAPI python library from ucfopen to help with responding to discussion board posts from students each week. I have had a couple of times when running the script shown in that post where something goes slightly awry: perhaps I have mistyped one of the student or assignment ids and the script runs into an error while iterating through the dataframe that contains all of the data I want to upload.</description></item><item><title>Network Graph Visualization with Bokeh (Testing)</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2023-02-05-network-visualization-with-bokeh/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 00:06:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2023-02-05-network-visualization-with-bokeh/</guid><description>Just testing the interactive bokeh plot here:

I have improved things quite a bit and made the worfklow a whole lot easier. I figured I could, once again, take everyone through the steps to see if it might be at all helpful for others with similar use-cases.</description></item><item><title>Automating Canvas Discussion Board Grading and Feedback</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-07-15-automating-canvas-grading-and-feedback_22/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jul 2022 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-07-15-automating-canvas-grading-and-feedback_22/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;re like me and you do a lot of teaching online (I know, I know, who among us don&amp;rsquo;t fit into that category today?) with courses that are really &amp;ldquo;Discussion Board&amp;rdquo;-heavy, you know that responding to students through Canvas&amp;rsquo;s LMS is, on its face, a bit of a bear. I have a tendency to produce some rather extensive comments to student posts each and every week. As Canvas veterans know all too well, there are all kinds of things about Canvas that are frighteningly &amp;ldquo;user-hostile,&amp;rdquo; as Robby Burns puts it.</description></item></channel></rss>
