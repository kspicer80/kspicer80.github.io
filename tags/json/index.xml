I have had a couple of times when running the script shown in that post where something goes slightly awry: perhaps I have mistyped one of the student or assignment ids and the script runs into an error while iterating through the dataframe that contains all of the data I want to upload.</description></item><item><title>Network Graph Visualization with Bokeh</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2023-02-05-network-visualization-with-bokeh/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 00:06:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2023-02-05-network-visualization-with-bokeh/</guid><description>Just testing the interactive bokeh plot here:

I have improved things quite a bit and made the worfklow a whole lot easier.

I have a tendency to produce some rather extensive comments to student posts each and every week. As Canvas veterans know all too well, there are all kinds of things about Canvas that are frighteningly &amp;ldquo;user-hostile,&amp;rdquo; as Robby Burns puts it.</description></item></channel></rss>
