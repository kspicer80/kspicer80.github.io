I was also thinking about my initial [MLB post](where we were looking at Skenes and Kershaw). I can imagine a reader wondering how we determined what an &amp;ldquo;optimistic&amp;rdquo; versus &amp;ldquo;pessimistic&amp;rdquo; trajectory for Skenes ultimately is &amp;hellip; I figured I would answer that in my writeup here of our Skenes vs. Skubal&amp;rsquo;s career K potential/trajectory. So let&amp;rsquo;s go producing a similar side-by-side comparison for these two but with the initial steps not being left out/omitted.</description></item><item><title>More MLB Visualizations ...

I figured we could use the code from our previous blog post looking at Paul Skenes and Clatyton Kershaw and see what we can see; just a couple changes to the player we&amp;rsquo;re looking at and weâ€™re good to go:</description></item><item><title>We've Done Some NBA and WNBA Data Analysis ...

Having earlier watched Pittsburgh Pirates ace Paul Skenes go, I wonder if we could visualize the possibilities of the latter eventually clearing that line.
We can project Paul Skenes&amp;rsquo;s trajectory based on some estimates&amp;mdash;whether we&amp;rsquo;re really optimistic in certain K numbers per game or pessimistic&amp;mdash;and we get something like this:</description></item></channel></rss>
