I have had a couple of times when running the script shown in that post where something goes slightly awry: perhaps I have mistyped one of the student or assignment ids and the script runs into an error while iterating through the dataframe that contains all of the data I want to upload.</description></item><item><title>Automating Syllabus Updating</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-12-19-syllabus-maker-stuff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2022 00:13:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-12-19-syllabus-maker-stuff/</guid><description>In my previous post I mentioned off-handedly the task of updating the dates on my syllabi as I transition from the Fall to the Spring to the Summer semesters.

I have a tendency to produce some rather extensive comments to student posts each and every week. As Canvas veterans know all too well, there are all kinds of things about Canvas that are frighteningly &amp;ldquo;user-hostile,&amp;rdquo; as Robby Burns puts it.</description></item></channel></rss>
