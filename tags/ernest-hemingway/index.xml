It was only after posting it that I noticed that Justin Rice beat me to the punch with his post &amp;ldquo;What Makes Hemingway Hemingway?&amp;rdquo; over on &amp;ldquo;The LitCharts Blog&amp;rdquo;. What was terribly curious to me was that Rice showcases some of the key characteristics that one thinks &amp;ldquo;makes Hemingway Hemingway&amp;rdquo;â€”sentence length, word length, lexical richness, dialogue proportion, parts of speech, characteristic words, and much more.</description></item><item><title>Fitzgerald ...

I spent quite a bit of time canvassing a great deal of the DH/computer programming learning I have acquired over the last couple of years. I gave a somewhat interesting test project version of some more stylometry/text classification work,1 focusing quite directly on some work another (former) student of mine, William Mastin, and I have been doing on one of his most favorite authors, Ernest Hemingway.</description></item></channel></rss>
