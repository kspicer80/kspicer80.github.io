I have improved things quite a bit and made the worfklow a whole lot easier. I figured I could, once again, take everyone through the steps to see if it might be at all helpful for others with similar use-cases.</description></item><item><title>Comparing Stylistic Tendencies Recent United States Supreme Court Justices (Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett)</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-07-11-pca-analysis-of-recent-new-justices_21/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-07-11-pca-analysis-of-recent-new-justices_21/</guid><description>General Introduction (All of the code for this post is available in this repo here.)
Continuing off of the last two posts (here and here), I thought we might continue seeing what we could do with our Supreme Court Opinions dataset(s)—I was also fascinated and inspired by a nice little article on Wikipedia about the &amp;ldquo;Ideological leanings of United States Supreme Court justices,&amp;rdquo; which has some really nice images. I thought one might do a little exploratory work with the opinions of some of the more recently appointed Justices: in particular I wanted to look at the work done so far by Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett; perhaps a little PCA work to see if we could work through any potential stylistic similarities between their opinions so far.</description></item><item><title>Topic Modeling the United States Supreme Court Utilizing the Top2Vec Library</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-07-07-top2vec-topic-modeling_20/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 00:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-07-07-top2vec-topic-modeling_20/</guid><description>Here in this post I&amp;rsquo;d like to continue working on the same project used in the previous post (here) while trying out the Top2Vec library). As is so often the case, I came across this library via Dr. William Mattingly&amp;rsquo;s YoutTube channel, who devoted two different videos to using this library (here and here). So let&amp;rsquo;s jump in and see what we can do with this library.
This time around we&amp;rsquo;re using a slightly different dataset that comes Kaggle—it contains all of the USSC opinions from 1970 on.</description></item><item><title>Topic Modeling the United States Supreme Court Surrounding Abortion</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-07-06-topic-modeling-the-ussc_19/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-07-06-topic-modeling-the-ussc_19/</guid><description>General Background (All code from this section is available in this repository here.)
Friday of last week, June 24th, 2022, was a profoundly dark day for a great many of us in the United States. Feeling somewhat helpless as the Supreme Court published the final draft of Dobbs v. Jackson Women&amp;rsquo;s Health Organization, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but fall back on old patterns. Not really knowing what else to do—I had a student with whom I had recently read the leaked original draft posted by Politico—I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but say to her when the opinion came down that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what else to do other than to get to reading.</description></item><item><title>Linear Regression in the Humanities(?!?!) ... not quite</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-06-01-linear-regression-in-the-humanities_18/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-06-01-linear-regression-in-the-humanities_18/</guid><description>Working my way through some of the new lessons from Codecademy&amp;rsquo;s new &amp;ldquo;Data Scientist: Natural Language Processing Specialist&amp;rdquo; path, I was returning to some of the lessons on linear regression usage in machine learning contexts. I also happened across a really fantastic post from the &amp;ldquo;LaTeX Ninja&amp;rdquo; on &amp;ldquo;Machine Learning for the Humanities: A Very Short Introduction&amp;rdquo;—I hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet come across this site yet and find it full of all kinds of fantastic little nuggets.</description></item><item><title>More _The Turn of the Screw_ Data Analysis</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-05-27-henry-james-turn-of-the-screw-data-analysis_16/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2022 11:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-05-27-henry-james-turn-of-the-screw-data-analysis_16/</guid><description>I know I mentioned in an earlier post—and here—that I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a bunch of work with Henry James&amp;rsquo;s canonical The Turn of the Screw. I thought I would post a little bit more here of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to as of late with this. A student of mine was fascinated by the use of the words &amp;ldquo;prodigious&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;portentous&amp;rdquo; in the Governess&amp;rsquo;s narrative in Turn. She said she noticed it frequently.</description></item></channel></rss>
