As Department Chair, a good deal of the Assessment Reports each year fall to me. Historically, for the past couple of years I have been more than content to simply just keep all of the scores on our assessed outcomes in one gigantic Excel spreadsheet.</description></item><item><title>Playing with Plain Text and CSS Templates</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2021-12-27-playing-with-plain-text-and-css-templates_05/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Dec 2021 12:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2021-12-27-playing-with-plain-text-and-css-templates_05/</guid><description>Over the past few months I have been thinking a great deal about how to incorporate all this new knowledge about digital methodology, data science, data analytics, (scholarly and non-scholarly) work/writing in the &amp;ldquo;digital&amp;rdquo; era into the way I do things as a scholar, teacher, thinker, etc. One of the key people that has been really informative for me has been Jonathan Reeve over at Columbia University. One of his posts from earlier this year, &amp;ldquo;Rethinking the MLA Style Research Paper&amp;rdquo; was incredibly generative for me—and it nicely dovetailed with some work my Departmental colleagues have been doing on thinking about writing at our university (a project generously funded by the Arthur Vining Davis Foundation).</description></item><item><title>Visualizing Online Class Discussion Boards</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2019-12-31-visualizing-online-class-discussion-boards_04/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 12:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2019-12-31-visualizing-online-class-discussion-boards_04/</guid><description>A Fantastic Anthology
So, this last semester I did another &amp;ldquo;Introduction to Literature&amp;rdquo; course (as I so often do)—this time around I decided to set the theme around that of &amp;ldquo;weird fiction.&amp;rdquo; Since the South Bend DHRI last May I have been thinking a great deal about this whole &amp;ldquo;data visualization&amp;rdquo; thing. I wanted to find some way to visually represent the stories in the anthology that students were gravitating to from week to week.</description></item><item><title>Still Playing Around with Python, NLTK, spaCy, etc.</title><link>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2019-12-24-still-playing-around-with-python-nltk-spacy-etc_03/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2019 12:05:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2019-12-24-still-playing-around-with-python-nltk-spacy-etc_03/</guid><description>Ugh, so clearly my discipline in posting is nonexistent.

This past July I got an opportunity to do a NEH Summer Seminar over at the University of Iowa (&amp;quot;Religion, Secularism, and the Novel&amp;quot;), where the group read a number of canonical novels (Crusoe, Silas Marner, Dracula, On the Road, and Home).</description></item></channel></rss>
