All right, so given that I'm new to the whole stock market sphere, I started by going to YouTube and came across a nice channel, [John's Money Adventures](https://www.youtube.com/@Johnsmoneyadventures). I watched many of his videos, but got interested in this most recent [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAaVjzEj1F8&t=4s) about 5 stocks that have shown low 52-week lows and that are predicted to make comebacks. The analyses of each of the suggested companies (John was looking at stocker symbols "AOS", "DHR", "AVY", "BCO", "CHE") struck me as well-reasoned, cogent and persuasive, so I bought some in all of them. 

That video was posted back in December of last year ... how are they looking now?
