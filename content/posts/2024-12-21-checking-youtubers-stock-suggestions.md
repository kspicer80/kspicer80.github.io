All right, so given that I'm new to the whole stock market sphere, I started by going to YouTube and came across a nice channel, [John's Money Adventures](https://www.youtube.com/@Johnsmoneyadventures). I watched many of his videos, but got interested in this most recent [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAaVjzEj1F8&t=4s) about 5 stocks that have shown low 52-week lows and that are predicted to make comebacks. I thought I would run these through my pipelines to see what they thought.
