    <p>For those that would prefer to read this document in a .pdf version, they can head over <a href="/post_tenure/shoring_up_the_oedipal_detective_game_in_section_1_with_makenzie_additions_v1.pdf">here</a>. In that version I have some brief comments in this section about why one might want to prefer the .html version here rather than the .pdf.</p>

    <p>I am well-aware that the guidelines for the “Post-Tenure Review”
    process in the <em>Policy Manual</em> explicitly note (2.9.5) that this
    document should present “a reflective narrative on the progress toward
    achieving the goals set at the last review and updated goals for the
    next five years of practice including how they fulfill the University’s
    defined
    mission.”<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span
