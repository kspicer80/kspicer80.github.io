After a few semesters of planning and learning, my Department is rolling out the sixth and final course in a slate of courses designed to get Illinois teachers ready and credentialed to teach dual-credit English composition courses in their high schools. This has been in partnership with my current institution's College of Education, the ["REAL Academy"](https://www.stfrancis.edu/real/courses/) and it has been quite a whirlwind road, lots of fun, lots of work, lots of opportunity for me to learn all kinds of new things. Here in the first module of the Summer semester I am running the ENGE/ENGM515 course focused on "Digital Rhetoric."

We're barely a week into the seminar here, but already I've having quite a bit of fun. We're hoping to look at som fairly canonical texts—Douglas Eyman's [_Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, and Practice_](https://www.press.umich.edu/4536325/digital_rhetoric), Collin Gifford Brooke's [_Lingua Fracta: Towards a Rhetoric of New Media_](https://books.google.com/books/about/Lingua_Fracta.html?id=5CgLAQAAMAAJ), and much, much more. I quite like Brooke's text, especially since it pulls very few punches and still strikes me as incredibly relevant in its overall argument and claim, namely, that those of us working in rhetoric and composition need to attend to the computational/digital infrastructures that allow us to do what it is that we do in the classroom with writing. Case in point, here is Brooke in the "Coda": 

> I find it increasingly irresponsible to study rhetoric and writing without accounting in some way for the various impacts of information and communication technologies. Likewise, I do not think that it is possible to understand these technologies without an appreciation of their rhetorical effects, both qua technology and as players in our discursive ecologies.

I couldn't agree more with such a thing—although, for myself, I am wondering just exactly how far down the rabbit hold I want to go in terms of "accounting ... for the various impacts of information and communication technologies" when we think about and study rhetoric.
