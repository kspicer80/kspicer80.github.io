In my DH journey, the work of [Dr. William Mattingly](https://pythonhumanities.com/python-for-dh-course/) has been something of a constant companion and guide.

His video laying out the steps for a ["Binary Data Classification"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPgQH5UTC9k) were clear quite clarifying for me in all kinds of ways. The classifier's job in this video was to see if it could tell the difference between the work of Oscar Wilde and Dan Brown. What if we tried a different pair of authors/texts? As off-handed mentioned in my previous [post](https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-03-29-vector-space-models-and-shakespeare/)
