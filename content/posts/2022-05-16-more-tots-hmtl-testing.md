All right, so let's do a little bit of testing of the whole XML through XSLT process to get an HTML version of James's _The Turn of the Screw_ with all my colored tags for it.

The original .xml and .xsl file are up and available in the GitHub [repo](https://github.com/kspicer80/henry_james/tree/main/tei).
