So there's been a lot of talk lately about [Microstrategy's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR/) seemingly almost constant buys of Bitcoin. There's also been quite a lot of chatter recently about some other hardware companies, ([Marvel Technologies](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MRVL/), [MARA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MARA/), etc.) getting involved. We also have things like ["Coinbase"](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/COIN/) that is frequently linked to Bitcoin as well. 

I thought I would do some coding to see how correlated these stock tickers are with Bitcoin. But before that I wrote some code to see how correlated the Dow Jones and NASDAQ were with BTC-USD. Do our "normal" markets just follow what Bitcoin's up to ...? Here's an exploratory [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) with some analysis:

Repo containing this and lots of other code is available [here](https://github.com/kspicer80/stock_stuff/tree/main).
