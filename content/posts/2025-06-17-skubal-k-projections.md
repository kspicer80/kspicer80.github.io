With [Tarik Skubal](https://www.fangraphs.com/players/tarik-skubal/22267/stats?position=P) on the mound tomorrow---Wednesday, June 18---for the Tigers against Pittsburgh, considered by many to be the best pitcher in baseball, I thought we could take a look at Skubal's projections real quick as a larf. I figured we could use the code from our [previous blog post](https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2025-06-15-skenes-vs-kershaw-career-strikeouts/) looking at Paul Skenes and Clatyton Kershaw and see what we can see; just a couple changes to the player we're looking at and weâ€™re good to go:

Perhaps I'll do some side-by-side comparisons between Skubal and Skenes. I'm sure I will. More to come.
