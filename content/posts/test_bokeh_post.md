#### Let's test it!

Here is a bit of markdown--and then below we want to try the bokeh plot just using the HTML:

{{< include-html "static/html/2021_02-14_usf_tweet_bokeh.html" >}}

And then we could have some more markdown here too! If I'm lucky we'll get the image above ... obviously, the hugo shortcode makes things much easier going forward.
