The final project for Codecademy's ["Building a Machine Learning Model with Python"](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/machine-learning) Skill Path asks students to do a little work with the "OK Cupid" [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/okcupid-profiles)â€”the project is humorously, punningly titled: "Date-A-Scientist." Students were tasked with trying to build some models to make predictions on this dataset. A Jupyter notebook with all the code and results follows here:
