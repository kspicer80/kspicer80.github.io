<font color=teal>The story had held us,</font> round the <font color=maroon>fire,</font> sufficiently breathless, but except the obvious
remark that it was gruesome, as, on <font color=GreenYellow>Christmas
Eve</font> in an old house, a strange tale should essentially be, I
remember no comment uttered till somebody happened to say that it was the
only case he had met in which such a visitation had fallen on a child. <font color=mistyrose>The case,</font> I may mention, was that of an
apparition in just such an old house as had gathered us for the occasion—an
appearance, of a dreadful kind, to a little boy sleeping in the room with
his mother and waking her up in the terror of it; waking her not to
dissipate his dread and soothe him to sleep again, but to encounter also,
herself, before she had succeeded in doing so, the same sight that had <font color=teal>shaken him.</font>
It was this observation that drew from Douglas—not immediately, but <font color=Olive>later in the
evening</font>—a reply that had the interesting consequence to which I
call attention. Someone else told a story not particularly effective, <font color=magenta>which I saw he was not following.</font> This I
took for a sign that he had himself something to produce and that we should
only have to wait. We waited in fact till <font color=GreenYellow>two nights
later</font>; but that before we scattered, he brought out what was in
his mind.</div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>
<font color=paleturquoise>“I quite
agree—in regard to Griffin’s ghost, or whatever it was—that its
appearing first to the little boy, at so tender an age, adds a
particular <font color=teal>touch.</font> But it’s not the
first occurrence of its charming kind that I know to have involved a
child. If the child gives the effect another turn of the screw, what do
you say to <em>two</em> children—?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>“We
say, of course,” somebody exclaimed, <font color=SaddleBrown>“that they give two
turns! Also that we want to hear about them.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>I can see Douglas there <font color=maroon>before the fire,</font> to which he had got up to present his back,
looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in his pockets. <font color=paleturquoise>“Nobody but me,
till now, has ever heard. It’s quite too horrible.”</font> This,
naturally, was declared by several voices to give the thing the utmost
price, and our friend, with quiet art, prepared his triumph by <font color=magenta>turning his eyes over</font> the rest of us and
going on: <font color=paleturquoise>“It’s
beyond everything. Nothing at all that I know <font color=teal>touches</font> it.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>
<font color=BlueViolet>“For sheer terror?”</font>
I remember asking.</div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>He seemed to say it was not so simple as that; to be really at a loss how to
qualify it. <font color=teal>He passed his hand over his
eyes,</font> made a little wincing grimace. <font color=paleturquoise>“For
dreadful—dreadfulness!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=7><sup>¶7</sup>
<font color=SaddleBrown><font color=darkgreen>“Oh, how delicious!”</font></font> cried one
of the women.</div><div class=paragraph n=8><sup>¶8</sup>He took no notice of her; he <font color=magenta>looked at me,</font>
but as if, instead of me, <font color=magenta>he saw what he spoke
of.</font>
<font color=paleturquoise>“For general uncanny
ugliness and horror and pain.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=9><sup>¶9</sup>
<font color=BlueViolet>“Well then,”</font> I
said, <font color=BlueViolet>“just sit right
down and begin.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=10><sup>¶10</sup>
<font color=maroon>He turned round to the fire,</font> gave a kick to a log,
watched it an instant. <font color=magenta>Then as he faced us
again:</font>
<font color=paleturquoise><font color=lightpink>“I can’t
begin. I shall have to send to town.”</font></font>
<font color=sienna>There was a unanimous groan at this,</font> and
much reproach; after which, in his preoccupied way, he explained. <font color=paleturquoise><font color=whitesmoke>“The story’s written.</font> It’s in a locked
drawer—it has not been out for <font color=GreenYellow>years</font>. <font color=whitesmoke>I
could write to my man</font> and enclose the key; he could send down
the packet as he finds it.”</font> It was to me in particular that he
appeared to propound this—<font color=lightpink>appeared almost to appeal for aid
not to hesitate.</font>
<font color=orange>He had broken a thickness of ice, the
formation of many a <font color=Olive>winter</font>;</font>
<font color=lightpink><font color=sienna>had had his reasons for a long
silence.</font></font>
<font color=lightpink>The others resented postponement,</font> but it was just his
scruples that charmed me. <font color=whitesmoke>I adjured him to write by the
first post</font> and to agree with us for an early <font color=sienna><font color=sienna>hearing;</font></font>
then I asked him if the experience in question had been his own. To this his
answer was prompt.</div><div class=paragraph n=11><sup>¶11</sup>
<font color=paleturquoise>“Oh, thank God,
no!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=12><sup>¶12</sup>
<font color=BlueViolet>“And is the <font color=whitesmoke>record</font> yours? <font color=whitesmoke>You took the
thing down?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=13><sup>¶13</sup>
<font color=paleturquoise>“Nothing but the
impression. I took that <em>here</em>”</font>—<font color=teal>he tapped his heart.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=14><sup>¶14</sup>
<font color=paleturquoise>“I’ve never lost it.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=15><sup>¶15</sup>
<font color=BlueViolet><font color=whitesmoke>“Then
your manuscript—?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=16><sup>¶16</sup>
<font color=paleturquoise><font color=whitesmoke>“Is in
old, faded ink, and in the most beautiful hand.”</font></font>
<font color=lightpink>He hung fire again.</font>
<font color=paleturquoise>“A woman’s. She has been
dead these <font color=Olive>twenty years.</font>
<font color=purple>She sent me the pages in question before she
died.”</font></font> They were all <font color=sienna>listening</font> now, and of course there was somebody to be arch, or at
any rate to draw the inference. But if he put the inference by without a
smile it was also without irritation. <font color=paleturquoise>“She was a most charming
person, but she was ten years older than I. She was my sister’s "governess,”</font> he quietly
said.<font color=paleturquoise>“She was the most
agreeable woman I’ve ever known in her position; she would have been
worthy of any whatever. It was long ago, and this episode was long
before. I was at Trinity, and I found her at home on my coming down the <font color=GreenYellow><font color=Olive>second summer.</font></font> I was much there that
<font color=GreenYellow>year</font>—it was a beautiful one; and we had, <font color=Olive>in her
off-hours</font>, some strolls and talks in the garden—talks in
which she struck me as awfully clever and nice. Oh yes; don’t grin: I
liked her extremely and am glad to <font color=GreenYellow>this day</font> to think she
liked me, too. If she hadn’t she wouldn’t have told me. She had never
told anyone. It wasn’t simply that she said so, but that I knew she
hadn’t. I was sure; <font color=magenta>I could see.</font> You’ll
easily judge why when you <font color=sienna>hear.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=17><sup>¶17</sup>
<font color=BlueViolet>“Because the thing had
been such a scare?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=18><sup>¶18</sup>He continued to <font color=magenta>fix me.</font>
<font color=paleturquoise>“You’ll easily
judge,”</font>
<font color=mistyrose>he repeated:</font>
<font color=paleturquoise>“<em>you</em> will.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=19><sup>¶19</sup>
<font color=magenta>I fixed him,</font> too. <font color=BlueViolet><font color=magenta>“I see.</font>
She was in love.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=20><sup>¶20</sup>He laughed for the first time. <font color=paleturquoise>“You <em>are</em> acute. <font color=mistyrose>Yes, she was in love.</font> That is, she had been.
That came out—she couldn’t tell her story without its coming out. <font color=magenta>I saw it, and she saw I saw it;</font> but
neither of us spoke of it. <font color=lightpink>I remember the time and
the place—the corner of the lawn, the shade of the great beeches and
the long, hot <font color=Olive>summer</font> afternoon.</font> It
wasn’t a scene for a shudder; <font color=mediumpurple>but
oh—!”</font></font> He quitted the <font color=maroon>fire</font> and dropped
back into his chair.</div><div class=paragraph n=21><sup>¶21</sup>
<font color=bisque><font color=BlueViolet>“You’ll
receive the packet <font color=Olive>Thursday morning</font>?”</font></font> I
inquired.</div><div class=paragraph n=22><sup>¶22</sup>
<font color=paleturquoise><font color=lightpink>“Probably
not till <font color=bisque>the second post.”</font></font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=23><sup>¶23</sup>
<font color=BlueViolet><font color=mediumpurple>“Well then; after dinner—”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=24><sup>¶24</sup>
<font color=paleturquoise>“You’ll all meet me
here?”</font>
<font color=magenta>He looked us round again.</font>
<font color=paleturquoise>“Isn’t anybody going?”</font> It was almost the tone of hope.</div><div class=paragraph n=25><sup>¶25</sup>
<font color=BlueViolet>“Everybody will stay!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=26><sup>¶26</sup>
<font color=SlateBlue>“<em>I</em> will”</font>—and <font color=SlateBlue>“<em>I</em> will!”</font> cried the ladies whose
departure had been <font color=teal>fixed.</font>
<font color=magenta>Mrs.
Griffin, however, expressed the need for a little more
light.</font>
<font color=Orange>“Who was it she was in
love with?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=27><sup>¶27</sup>
<font color=BlueViolet>“The story will
tell,”</font> I took upon myself to reply.</div><div class=paragraph n=28><sup>¶28</sup>
<font color=SlateBlue><font color=lightpink>“Oh, I can’t wait for the story!”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=29><sup>¶29</sup>
<font color=paleturquoise><font color=mistyrose>“The story <em>won’t</em>
tell,”</font></font> said Douglas;
<font color=paleturquoise>“not in
any literal, vulgar way.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=30><sup>¶30</sup>
<font color=Orange>“More’s the pity, then.
That’s the only way I ever understand.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=31><sup>¶31</sup>
<font color=SaddleBrown>“Won’t <em>you</em> tell, Douglas?”</font> somebody else inquired.</div><div class=paragraph n=32><sup>¶32</sup>He sprang to his feet again. <font color=paleturquoise><font color=lightpink>“Yes—<font color=Olive>tomorrow</font>.</font> Now I must go to bed.
<font color=Olive>Good night</font>.”</font>
<font color=maroon><font color=teal>And quickly catching up a
candlestick,</font></font> he left us slightly bewildered. <font color=sienna>From our end of the great <font color=brown>brown</font> hall we heard his step on the stair;</font> whereupon
Mrs. Griffin spoke. <font color=Orange><font color=mistyrose>“Well, if I don’t know who she was in love with, I
know who <em>he</em> was.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=33><sup>¶33</sup>
<font color=Yellow>“She was <font color=GreenYellow>ten
years older</font>,”</font> said her husband.</div><div class=paragraph n=34><sup>¶34</sup>
<font color=Orange>“<em><em>Raison de
plus</em></em>—at that age! But it’s rather nice, his long
reticence.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=35><sup>¶35</sup>
<font color=Yellow>“<font color=GreenYellow>Forty
years</font>!”</font> Griffin put in.</div><div class=paragraph n=35><sup>¶35</sup>
<font color=Orange>“With this outbreak at
last.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=37><sup>¶37</sup>
<font color=BlueViolet>“The outbreak,”</font> I
returned, <font color=BlueViolet>“will make a tremendous
occasion of <font color=GreenYellow><font color=Olive>Thursday night</font>
</font>;”</font> and
everyone so agreed with me that, <font color=magenta>in the light
of it,</font> we lost all attention for everything else. The last story,
however incomplete and like the mere opening of a serial, had been told;
<font color=teal>we handshook</font> and <font color=maroon>“candlestuck,”</font> as somebody said, and went to
bed. I knew <font color=GreenYellow>the next day</font> that <font color=bisque>a letter
containing the key had, by the first post, gone off to his London apartments</font>; <font color=lightpink>but in spite of—or
perhaps just on account of—the eventual diffusion of this knowledge we
quite let him alone till after dinner, till <font color=Olive>such an hour of the
evening</font>,</font> in fact, <font color=teal>as might
best accord with the kind of emotion on which our hopes were
fixed.</font> Then he became as communicative as we could desire and
indeed gave us his best reason for being so. We had it from him again <font color=maroon>before the fire in the hall,</font> as we had had our mild
wonders of the previous night. <font color=lime>It appeared that the
narrative he had promised to read us really required for a proper
intelligence a few words of prologue.</font> Let me say here distinctly,
to have done with it, that this narrative, <font color=whitesmoke>from an exact
transcript of my own made much later, is what I shall presently
give.</font> Poor Douglas, before his
death—when it was in sight—<font color=whitesmoke>committed to me the
manuscript</font>
<font color=lightpink>that reached him on <font color=GreenYellow>the third of these
days</font></font> and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, <font color=lime>he began to read to our hushed little circle
<font color=GreenYellow><font color=Olive>on the night of the fourth</font>
</font>.</font>
<font color=mistyrose>The departing ladies who had said they would stay
didn’t, of course, thank heaven, stay:</font> they departed, in
consequence of arrangements made, in a rage of curiosity, as they professed,
produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up. But that
only made <font color=sienna>his little final auditory</font> more
compact and select, kept it, <font color=maroon>round the hearth,</font> subject
to a common thrill.</div><div class=paragraph n=38><sup>¶38</sup>The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the
tale at a point after it had, in a manner, begun. The fact to be in
possession of was therefore that his old friend, the youngest of several
daughters of a poor country parson, had, at the age of twenty, on taking
service for the first time in the schoolroom, come up to HampshireLondon, in trepidation, to answer in person an advertisement
that had already placed her in brief correspondence with the advertiser.
This person proved, on her presenting herself, for judgment, at a house in Harley Street, that impressed her as vast and imposing—this prospective
patron proved a gentleman, a bachelor in the prime of life, such a figure as
had never risen, save in a dream <font color=lime>or an old
novel,</font> before a fluttered, anxious girl out of a Hampshire vicarage. One could easily fix his type; it never, happily,
dies out. He was handsome and bold and pleasant, off-hand and gay and kind.
He struck her, inevitably, as gallant and splendid, but what took her most
of all and gave her the courage she afterward showed was that he put the
whole thing to her as a kind of favor, an obligation he should gratefully
incur. She conceived him as rich, but as fearfully extravagant—saw him all
in a glow of high fashion, of good looks, of expensive habits, of charming
ways with women. He had for his own town residence a big house filled with
the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase; but it was to his
country home, an old family place in Essex, that he wished her immediately to proceed.</div><div class=paragraph n=39><sup>¶39</sup>He had been left, by the death of their parents in India, guardian to a small nephew and a small niece, children of a
younger, a military brother, whom he had lost <font color=GreenYellow>two years before</font>.
These children were, by the strangest of chances for a man in his position—a
lone man without the right sort of experience or a grain of patience—<font color=teal>very heavily on his hands.</font> It had all been
a great worry and, on his own part doubtless, a series of blunders, but he
immensely pitied the poor chicks and had done all he could; had in
particular sent them down to his other house, the proper place for them
being of course the country, and kept them there, from the first, with the
best people he could find to look after them, parting even with his own
servants to wait on them and going down himself, whenever he might, <font color=magenta>to see how they were doing.</font> The awkward
thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own
affairs took up all his time. He had put them in possession of Bly, which was healthy and secure, and had placed at the head of
their little establishment—but below stairs only—an excellent woman,
Mrs. Grose, whom he was sure his
visitor would like and who had formerly been maid to his mother. She was now
housekeeper and was also acting for the time as superintendent to the little
girl, of whom, without children of her own, she was, by good luck, extremely
fond. There were plenty of people to help, but of course the young lady who
should go down as governess would be
in supreme authority. She would also have, in <font color=GreenYellow>holidays</font>, to look
after the small boy, who had been for a term at school—young as he was to be
sent, but what else could be done?—and who, as the holidays were about to
begin, would be back from one day to the other. There had been for the two
children at first a young lady whom they had had the misfortune to lose. She
had done for them quite beautifully—she was a most respectable person—till
her death, the great awkwardness of which had, precisely, left no
alternative but the school for little Miles. Mrs. Grose, since
then, in the way of manners and things, had done as she could for Flora; and there were, further, a cook, a
housemaid, a dairywoman, an old pony, an old groom, and an old gardener, all
likewise thoroughly respectable.</div><div class=paragraph n=40><sup>¶40</sup>So far had Douglas presented his picture
when someone put a question.</div><div class=paragraph n=41><sup>¶41</sup>
<font color=SaddleBrown>“And what did the
former governess die of?—of so
much respectability?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=42><sup>¶42</sup>Our friend’s answer was prompt. <font color=paleturquoise>“That will come out. I don’t
anticipate.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=43><sup>¶43</sup>
<font color=SaddleBrown>'“Excuse me—I
thought that was just what you <em>are</em>
doing.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=44><sup>¶44</sup>
<font color=BlueViolet>“In her
successor’s place,”</font>I suggested, <font color=BlueViolet><font color=mediumpurple>“I should have
wished to learn if the office brought with it—”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=45><sup>¶45</sup>
<font color=paleturquoise>“Necessary danger
to life?”</font>Douglas completed my thought. <font color=paleturquoise>“She did wish to
learn, and she did learn. You shall hear tomorrow what she learned.
Meanwhile, of course, the prospect struck her as slightly grim. She was
young, untried, nervous: it was a <font color=magenta>vision of
serious duties and little company, of really great loneliness.</font>
She hesitated—took a couple of days to consult and consider. But the
salary offered much exceeded her modest measure, and on a second
interview she faced the music, she engaged.”</font>
<font color=lightpink>And Douglas, with this,
made a pause that, for the benefit of the company, moved me to throw
in—</font></div><div class=paragraph n=46><sup>¶46</sup>
<font color=BlueViolet>“The moral of
which was of course the seduction exercised by the splendid young man.
She succumbed to it.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=47><sup>¶47</sup>He got up and, as he had done <font color=Olive>the night before</font>, <font color=maroon>went to the fire,</font> gave a stir to a log with his foot, then stood
a moment with his back to us.</div><div class=paragraph n=48><sup>¶48</sup>
<font color=paleturquoise><font color=magenta>“She saw him only twice.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=49><sup>¶49</sup>“Yes, but that’s just
the beauty of her passion.”</div><div class=paragraph n=50><sup>¶50</sup>A little to my surprise, on this, Douglas
turned round to me. <font color=paleturquoise>“It
<em>was</em> the beauty of it. There were
others,”</font> he went on, <font color=paleturquoise>“who hadn’t succumbed. He told her frankly all his
difficulty—that for several applicants the conditions had been
prohibitive. They were, somehow, simply afraid. It sounded dull—it
sounded strange; and all the more so because of his main
condition.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=51><sup>¶51</sup>
<font color=mediumpurple>“Which was—?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=52><sup>¶52</sup>
<font color=paleturquoise><font color=mistyrose>“That she should never trouble him—but never,
never:</font> neither appeal nor complain <font color=whitesmoke>nor
write about anything;</font> only meet all questions herself, receive
all moneys from his solicitor, take the whole thing over and let him
alone. She promised to do this, and she mentioned to me that when, for a
moment, disburdened, delighted, <font color=teal>he held her
hand,</font> thanking her for the sacrifice, she already felt
rewarded.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=53><sup>¶53</sup>
<font color=SaddleBrown>“But was that all
her reward?”</font> one of the ladies asked.</div><div class=paragraph n=54><sup>¶54</sup>
<font color=paleturquoise><font color=magenta>“She never saw him again.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=55><sup>¶55</sup>
<font color=SaddleBrown>“Oh!”</font>
said the lady; <font color=lightpink>which, as our friend immediately left us
again, was the only other word of importance contributed to the subject
till, <font color=Olive>the next night</font>,</font>
<font color=maroon>by the corner of the hearth,</font> in the best chair, he
opened the faded <font color=red>red</font> cover of a thin
old-fashioned gilt-edged album. The whole thing took indeed more nights than
one, but on the first occasion the same lady put another question. <font color=SaddleBrown>“What is your
title?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=56><sup>¶56</sup>
<font color=BlueViolet>“I haven’t
one.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=57><sup>¶57</sup>
<font color=BlueViolet>“Oh, <em>I</em> have!”</font> I said. But Douglas, without heeding me, <font color=lime>had begun to read</font>
<font color=sienna>with a fine clearness that was like a rendering to
the ear</font>
<font color=magenta>of the beauty of his author’s hand.</font></div></div><div class=chapter n=1><h3>Chapter: 1</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>I remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops, a little
seesaw of the right throbs and the wrong. After rising, in town, to meet his
appeal, I had at all events a couple of <font color=GreenYellow>very bad days</font>—found
myself doubtful again, felt indeed sure I had made a mistake. In this state
of mind I spent <font color=Olive>the long hours</font> of bumping, swinging coach that
carried me to the stopping place at which I was to be met by a vehicle from
the house. This convenience, I was told, had been ordered, and I found, <font color=lightpink>toward the close of the <font color=Olive>June</font>
<font color=Olive>afternoon</font>, a commodious fly in waiting for me. Driving at
that hour, on a lovely day, through a country to which the <font color=Olive>summer</font> sweetness</font> seemed to offer me a
friendly welcome, my fortitude mounted afresh and, as we turned into the
avenue, encountered a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the point to
which it had sunk. I suppose I had expected, or had dreaded, something so
melancholy that what greeted me was a good surprise. I remember as a most
pleasant impression the broad, clear front, its open windows and fresh
curtains and the pair of maids looking out; I remember the lawn and the
bright flowers and the crunch of my wheels on the gravel and the clustered
treetops over which the rooks circled and cawed in the <font color=gold>golden</font> sky. The scene had a greatness that
made it a different affair from my own scant home, and there immediately
appeared at the door, with a little girl in her hand, a civil person who
dropped me as decent a curtsy as if I had been the mistress or a
distinguished visitor. I had received in Harley Street a narrower notion of the place, and that, as I recalled it,
made me think the proprietor still more of a gentleman, suggested that what
I was to enjoy might be something beyond his promise.</div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>I had no drop again till <font color=Olive>the next day</font>, for I was carried
triumphantly through <font color=Olive>the following hours</font> by my introduction to
the younger of my pupils. The little girl who accompanied Mrs. Grose<font color=magenta>appeared to me on the spot a creature so charming
as to make it a great fortune to have to do with her. She was the most
beautiful child I had ever seen,</font> and I afterward wondered that my
employer had not told me more of her. I slept little that night—I was too
much excited; and this astonished me, too, I recollect, remained with me,
adding to my sense of the liberality with which I was treated. The large,
impressive room, one of the best in the house, the great state bed, <font color=teal>as I almost felt it,</font> the full, figured
draperies, the long glasses in which, for the first time, <font color=magenta>I could see myself from head to foot,</font> all
struck me—like the extraordinary charm of my small charge—as so many things
thrown in. It was thrown in as well, from the first moment, that I should
get on with Mrs. Grose in a relation
over which, on my way, in the coach, I fear I had rather brooded. The only
thing indeed that in this early outlook might have made me shrink again was
the clear circumstance <font color=magenta>of her being so glad to
see me. I perceived within <font color=Olive>half an hour</font> that she was so
glad—stout, simple, plain, clean, wholesome woman—as to be positively on
her guard against showing it too much. I wondered even then a little why
she should wish not to show it, and that, with reflection, with
suspicion, might of course have made me uneasy.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup> But it was a comfort that there could be no uneasiness in a connection with
anything so beatific as <font color=magenta>the radiant image of my
little girl, the vision of whose angelic beauty</font> had probably more
than anything else to do with the restlessness that, before morning, made me
several times rise and wander about my room to take in the whole picture and
prospect; <font color=magenta>to watch, from my open window, the faint <font color=Olive>summer</font> dawn, to look at such portions of the
rest of the house as I could catch,</font> and <font color=sienna>to
listen, while, in the fading dusk, the first birds began to twitter, for
the possible recurrence of a sound or two, less natural and not without,
but within, that I had fancied I heard.</font>
<font color=sienna>There had been a moment when I believed I recognized, faint
and far, the cry of a child;</font> there had been another when I found
myself just consciously starting as at the passage, before my door, of a
light footstep. <font color=magenta>But these fancies were not marked enough
not to be thrown off, and it is only in the light, or the gloom, I
should rather say, of other and subsequent matters that they now come
back to me.</font>
<font color=magenta>To watch,</font> teach, “form” little Flora would too evidently be the making of a
happy and useful life. It had been agreed between us downstairs that after
this first occasion I should have her as a matter of course at
<font color=Olive>night</font>, her small white bed
being already arranged, to that end, in my room. What I had undertaken was
the whole care of her, and she had remained, just this last time, with
Mrs. Grose only as an effect of our
consideration for my inevitable strangeness and her natural timidity. In
spite of this timidity—which the child herself, in the oddest way in the
world, had been perfectly frank and brave about, allowing it, without a sign
of uncomfortable consciousness, with the deep, sweet serenity indeed of one
of Raphael’s holy infants, to be discussed, to be imputed to her, and to
determine us—I feel quite sure she would presently like me. It was part of
what I already liked Mrs. Grose herself
for, the pleasure I could see her feel in my admiration and wonder as I sat
at supper with four tall candles and with my pupil, in a high chair and a
bib, brightly facing me, between them, over bread and milk. There were
naturally things that in Flora’s presence
could pass between us only as prodigious and gratified looks, obscure and
roundabout allusions.</div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=magenta>“And the little boy—does he look like her?</font> Is he
too so very remarkable?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>One wouldn’t flatter a child. <font color=Periwinkle>“Oh, miss, <em>most</em>
remarkable. If you think well of this one!”</font>—and she stood there
with a plate in her hand, <font color=magenta>beaming</font> at our companion,
who looked from one of us to the other with placid heavenly eyes that
contained nothing to check us.</div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Yes; if I do—?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=7><sup>¶7</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“You <em>will</em> be carried away by the little gentleman!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=8><sup>¶8</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Well, that, I think,
is what I came for—<font color=mistyrose>to be carried away.</font> I’m
afraid, however,”</font> I remember feeling the impulse to add, <font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“I’m rather easily carried away.</font>
<font color=mistyrose>I was carried away</font> in London”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=9><sup>¶9</sup>
<font color=magenta>I can still see Mrs.
Grose’s broad face</font> as she took this in. <font color=Periwinkle>“In Harley Street?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=10><sup>¶10</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“In Harley Street.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=11><sup>¶11</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Well, miss, you’re not
the first—and you won’t be the last.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=12><sup>¶12</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Oh, I’ve no
pretension,”</font> I could laugh, <font color=Indigo>“to being the only one. My other pupil, at any rate,
as I understand, comes back <font color=GreenYellow>tomorrow</font>?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=13><sup>¶13</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“<font color=GreenYellow>Not
tomorrow—Friday</font>, miss. He arrives, as you did, by the coach,
under care of the guard, and is to be met by the same carriage.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=14><sup>¶14</sup>I forthwith expressed that the proper as well as the pleasant and friendly
thing would be therefore that on the arrival of the public conveyance I
should be in waiting for him with his little sister; an idea in which
Mrs. Grose concurred so heartily that I somehow
took her manner as a kind of comforting pledge—never falsified, thank
heaven!—that we should on every question be quite at one. Oh, she was glad I
was there!</div><div class=paragraph n=15><sup>¶15</sup>What I felt <font color=GreenYellow>the next day</font> was, I suppose, nothing that could be
fairly called a reaction from the cheer of my arrival; it was probably at
the most only a slight oppression produced by a fuller measure of the scale,
as I walked round them, <font color=magenta>gazed up at them</font>,
took them in, of my new circumstances. They had, as it were, an extent and
mass for which I had not been prepared and in the presence of which I found
myself, freshly, a little scared as well as a little proud. <font color=lightpink>Lessons, in this agitation, certainly suffered some delay;</font> I
reflected that my first duty was, by the gentlest arts I could contrive, to
win the child into the sense of knowing me. I spent the day with her
out-of-doors; I arranged with her, to her great satisfaction, that it should
be she, she only, who might show me the place. She showed it step by step
and room by room and secret by secret, with droll, delightful, childish talk
about it and with the result, in <font color=Olive>half an hour</font>, of our becoming
immense friends. Young as she was, I was struck, throughout our little tour,
with her confidence and courage with the way, in empty chambers and dull
corridors, on crooked staircases that made me pause and even on the summit
of an old machicolated square tower that made me dizzy, her
<font color=Olive>morning</font> music, her disposition to tell me so many more
things than she asked, rang out and led me on. I have not seen Bly since <font color=GreenYellow>the day</font> I left it, <font color=magenta>and I daresay that to my older and more informed
eyes</font> it would now appear sufficiently contracted. But as my
little conductress, with her hair of <font color=gold>gold</font> and
her frock of <font color=azure>blue</font>, danced before me round
corners and pattered down passages, <font color=lime>I had
the view of a castle of romance inhabited by a rosy sprite, such a place
as would somehow, for diversion of the young idea, take all color out of
storybooks and fairytales. Wasn’t it just a storybook over which I had
fallen adoze and a dream?</font> No; it was a big, ugly, antique, but
convenient house, embodying a few features of a building still older,
half-replaced and half-utilized, in which I had the fancy of our being
almost as lost as a handful of passengers in a great drifting ship. Well, I
was, strangely, at the helm!</div></div><div class=chapter n=2><h3>Chapter: 2</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>This came home to me when, <font color=GreenYellow>two days later</font>, I drove over with
Flora to meet, as Mrs. Grose said, the little gentleman; and all
the more for an incident that, presenting itself <font color=GreenYellow><font color=Olive>the second
evening</font>
</font>, had deeply disconcerted me. <font color=GreenYellow>The first
day</font> had been, on the whole, as I have expressed, reassuring; but
I was to see it wind up in keen apprehension. <font color=bisque>The
postbag, that <font color=Olive>evening</font>—it came late—contained a letter for
me, which, however, in the hand of my employer, I found to be composed
but of a few words enclosing another, addressed to himself, with a seal
still unbroken.</font>
<font color=blueviolet>“This, I recognize, is from the headmaster, and the headmaster’s
an awful bore. Read him, please; deal with him; but mind you don’t
report. Not a word. I’m off!”</font> I broke the seal with a great effort—so great a one that I was a long
time coming to it; took the unopened missive at last up to my room and only
attacked it just before going to bed. I had better have let it wait till
<font color=Olive>morning</font>, for it gave me <font color=Olive>a second sleepless
night</font>. With no counsel to take, <font color=GreenYellow>the next day</font>, I was
full of distress; and it finally got so the better of me that <font color=lime>I determined to open myself at least to
Mrs. Grose.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“What does it mean? The
child’s dismissed his school.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>
<font color=magenta>She gave me a look that I remarked at the moment
; then, visibly, with a quick blankness,</font> seemed to try to take it
back. <font color=Periwinkle>“But aren’t they
all—?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Sent home—yes. But
only for <font color=GreenYellow>the holidays</font>. Miles may never go back at all.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>Consciously, under my attention, she reddened. <font color=Periwinkle>“They won’t take him?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“They absolutely
decline.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=7><sup>¶7</sup>
<font color=magenta>At this she raised her eyes, which she had turned
from me; I saw them fill with good tears.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“What has he
done?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=8><sup>¶8</sup>I hesitated; <font color=bisque>then I judged best simply to hand her my
letter—which, however, had the effect of making her, without taking it,
simply put her hands behind her.</font> She shook her head sadly. <font color=Periwinkle>“Such things are not for
me, miss.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=9><sup>¶9</sup>
<font color=lime>My counselor couldn’t read!</font> I winced at my mistake,
which I attenuated as I could, <font color=bisque>and opened my letter
again</font>
<font color=mistyrose>to repeat it to her;</font> then, faltering in the act
<font color=bisque>and folding it up once more, I put it back in my
pocket.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“Is he really <em>bad</em>?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=10><sup>¶10</sup>The tears were still in her eyes. <font color=Periwinkle>“Do the gentlemen say so?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=11><sup>¶11</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“They go into no
particulars. They simply express their regret that it should be
impossible to keep him. That can have only one meaning.” </font>Mrs. Grose listened with dumb emotion; she forbore to
ask me what this meaning might be; so that, presently, to put the thing with
some coherence and with the mere aid of her presence to my own mind, I went
on: <font color=Indigo>“That he’s an
injury to the others.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=12><sup>¶12</sup>At this, with one of the quick turns of simple folk, she suddenly <font color=maroon>flamed up</font>. <font color=Periwinkle>“Master Miles! <em>him</em> an injury?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=13><sup>¶13</sup>There was such a flood of good faith in it that, though I had not yet seen
the child, my very fears made me jump to the absurdity of the idea. I found
myself, to meet my friend the better, offering it, on the spot,
sarcastically. <font color=Indigo>“To his
poor little innocent mates!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=14><sup>¶14</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“It’s too
dreadful,”</font> cried Mrs. Grose,
<font color=Periwinkle>“to say such cruel
things! Why, he’s scarce ten years old.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=15><sup>¶15</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Yes, yes; it would be
incredible.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=16><sup>¶16</sup>She was evidently grateful for such a profession. <font color=Periwinkle><font color=magenta>“See him, miss, first.</font><em> Then</em> believe it!”</font>
<font color=magenta>I felt forthwith a new impatience to see him;</font> it was
the beginning of a curiosity that, <font color=Olive>for all the next hours</font>, was
to deepen almost to pain. Mrs. Grose was
aware, I could judge, of what she had produced in me, and she followed it up
with assurance.</div><div class=paragraph n=17><sup>¶17</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“You might as well
believe it of the little lady. Bless her,”</font> she added the next
moment— <font color=Periwinkle>“<em>look</em> at her!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=18><sup>¶18</sup>I turned and <font color=magenta>saw that Flora, whom, <font color=Olive>ten minutes before</font>, I had
established in the schoolroom with a sheet of white paper, a pencil, and a copy of nice “round O’s,” now
presented herself to view at the open door.</font> She expressed in her
little way an extraordinary detachment from disagreeable duties, looking to
me, however, with a great childish light that seemed to offer it as a mere
result of the affection she had conceived for my person, which had rendered
necessary that she should follow me. I needed nothing more than this to feel
the full force of Mrs. Grose’s
comparison, and, <font color=teal>catching my pupil in my arms,
covered her with kisses in which there was a sob of atonement.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=19><sup>¶19</sup>Nonetheless, the rest of the day I watched for further occasion to approach
my colleague, especially as, <font color=Olive>toward evening</font>, I began to fancy
she rather sought to avoid me. I overtook her, I remember, on the staircase;
we went down together, and at the bottom I detained her, holding her there with a hand on her arm.<font color=Indigo>“I take what you said
to me <font color=Olive>at noon</font> as a declaration that <em>you’ve</em> never known him to be bad.”</font> She threw back
her head; she had clearly, by this time, and very honestly, adopted an
attitude. <font color=Periwinkle>“Oh, never
known him—I don’t pretend <em>that!</em>”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=20><sup>¶20</sup>I was upset again. <font color=Indigo>“Then
you <em>have</em> known him—?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=21><sup>¶21</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Yes indeed, miss,
thank God!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=22><sup>¶22</sup>On reflection I accepted this. <font color=Indigo><font color=mediumpurple>You mean that a boy who never is—?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=23><sup>¶23</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Is no boy for <em>me!</em>”></font></div><div class=paragraph n=24><sup>¶24</sup>
<font color=teal>I held her tighter.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“You like them with the
spirit to be naughty?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=25><sup>¶25</sup>Then, keeping pace with her answer, <font color=Indigo>“So do I!”</font> I eagerly brought out.</div><div class=paragraph n=26><sup>¶26</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“But not to the degree
to contaminate—”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=27><sup>¶27</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“To
contaminate?”</font>—my big word left her at a loss. I explained it.
<font color=Indigo>“To
corrupt.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=28><sup>¶28</sup>
<font color=magenta>She stared,</font> taking my meaning in; but it
produced in her an odd laugh.</div><div class=paragraph n=29><sup>¶29</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Are you afraid he’ll
corrupt <em>you?</em>”</font> She put the question
with such a fine bold humor that, with a laugh, a little silly doubtless, to
match her own, I gave way for the time to the apprehension of ridicule.</div><div class=paragraph n=30><sup>¶30</sup>But <font color=GreenYellow>the next day</font>, as <font color=Olive>the hour</font> for my drive
approached, I cropped up in another place. <font color=Indigo>“What was the lady who was here
before?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=31><sup>¶31</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“The last governess? She was also young
and pretty—almost as young and almost as pretty, miss, even as you.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=32><sup>¶32</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Ah, then, I hope her
youth and her beauty helped her!”</font> I recollect throwing off.
<font color=Indigo>“He seems to like
us young and pretty!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=33><sup>¶33</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Oh, he <em>did</em>,” </font>Mrs. Grose assented: <font color=Periwinkle>“it was the way he liked
everyone!”</font>
<font color=teal>She had no sooner spoken indeed than she caught
herself up.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=34><sup>¶34</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“I mean that’s <em>his</em> way—the master’s.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=35><sup>¶35</sup>I was struck. <font color=Indigo>“But of
whom did you speak first?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=36><sup>¶36</sup>
<font color=magenta>She looked blank, but she colored.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Why, of <em>him</em>.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=37><sup>¶37</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Of the master?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=38><sup>¶38</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Of who else?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=39><sup>¶39</sup>There was so obviously no one else that the next moment I had lost my
impression of her having accidentally said more than she meant; and I merely
asked what I wanted to know. <font color=Indigo><font color=magenta>“Did <em>she</em> see
anything in the boy—?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=40><sup>¶40</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“That wasn’t right? She
never told me.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=41><sup>¶41</sup>I had a scruple, but I overcame it. <font color=Indigo>“Was she careful—particular?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=42><sup>¶42</sup>Mrs. Grose appeared to try to be
conscientious. <font color=Periwinkle>“About
some things—yes.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=43><sup>¶43</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“But not about
all?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=44><sup>¶44</sup>Again she considered. <font color=Periwinkle>“Well, miss—she’s gone. I won’t tell tales.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=45><sup>¶45</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“I quite understand
your feeling,”</font> I hastened to reply; but I thought it, after an
instant, not opposed to this concession to pursue: <font color=Indigo>“Did she die here?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=46><sup>¶46</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“No—she went
off.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=47><sup>¶47</sup>I don’t know what there was in this brevity of Mrs.
Grose’s that struck me as ambiguous. <font color=Indigo>“Went off to die?”</font>Mrs. Grose looked straight out of the
window, but I felt that, hypothetically, I had a right to know what young
persons engaged for Bly were expected to do. <font color=Indigo>“She was taken ill, you mean, and went home?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=48><sup>¶48</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“She was not taken ill,
so far as appeared, in this house. She left it, <font color=GreenYellow>at the
end of the year</font>, to go home, as she said, for <font color=Olive>a short
holiday</font>, to which the time she had put in had certainly given
her a right. We had then a young woman—a nursemaid who had stayed on and
who was a good girl and clever; and <em>she</em>
took the children altogether for the interval. But our young lady never
came back, and at the very moment I was expecting her I heard from the
master that she was dead.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=49><sup>¶49</sup>I turned this over. <font color=Indigo>“But
of what?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=50><sup>¶50</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“He never told me! But
please, miss,”</font> said Mrs.
Grose, <font color=Periwinkle>“I must get to my work.”</font></div></div><div class=chapter n=3><h3>Chapter: 3</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>Her thus turning her back on me was fortunately not, for my just
preoccupations, a snub that could check the growth of our mutual esteem. We
met, after I had brought home little Miles,
more intimately than ever on the ground of my stupefaction, my general
emotion: so monstrous was I then ready to pronounce it that such a child as
had now been revealed to me should be under an interdict. I was a little
late on the scene, and I felt, <font color=magenta>as he stood
wistfully looking out for me before the door of the inn at which the
coach had put him down, that I had seen him, on the instant, without and
within, in the great glow of freshness, the same positive fragrance of
purity, in which I had, from the first moment, seen his little sister.</font> He was incredibly beautiful, and Mrs.
Grose had put her finger on it: everything but a sort of
passion of tenderness for him was swept away by his presence. <font color=teal>What I then and there took him to my heart for</font> was something divine that I have never found to the same degree in
any child—his indescribable little air of knowing nothing in the world but
love. It would have been impossible to carry a bad name with a greater
sweetness of innocence, and by the time I had got back to Bly with him I remained merely bewildered—so far, that is, as I was
not outraged—by the sense of the <font color=bisque>horrible letter locked
up in my room, in a drawer.</font> As soon as I could compass a private
word with Mrs. Grose I declared to her
that it was grotesque.</div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>She promptly understood me. <font color=Periwinkle>“You mean the cruel charge—?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“It doesn’t live an
instant. <font color=magenta>My dear woman, <em>look</em> at him!”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>She smiled at my pretention to have discovered his charm. <font color=Periwinkle>“I assure you, miss, I do
nothing else! What will you say, then?”</font> she immediately added.</div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=bisque>“In answer to the letter?”</font></font> I had made up my mind. <font color=Indigo>“Nothing.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“And to his

<font color=Periwinkle>“And to the boy

<font color=Indigo><font color=magenta><font color=mistyrose>“We’ll see it out!”</font></font></font> I ardently echoed, <font color=teal>giving her my hand to
make it a vow.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=12><sup>¶12</sup>
<font color=teal>She held me there a moment,</font> then whisked up

<font color=Indigo>“To kiss me?
No!”</font>
<font color=teal>I took the good creature in my arms and, after we
had embraced like sisters,</font> felt still more fortified and
indignant.</div><div class=paragraph n=14><sup>¶14</sup>This, at all events, was for the time: a time so full that, as I recall the
way it went, it reminds me of all the art I now need to make it a little
distinct. What I look back at with amazement is the situation I accepted. I
had undertaken, with my companion, to see it out, and I was under a charm,
apparently, that could smooth away the extent and the far and difficult
connections of such an effort. I was lifted aloft ona great wave of
infatuation and pity. I found it simple, in my ignorance, my confusion, and
perhaps my conceit, to assume that I could deal with a boy whose education
for the world was all on the point of beginning. I am unable even to
remember at <font color=Olive>this day</font> what proposal I framed for the end of his
holidays and the resumption of his studies. Lessons with me, indeed, that
charming <font color=GreenYellow>summer</font>, we all had a theory that he was
to have; but I now feel that, <font color=Olive>for weeks</font>, the lessons must have
been rather my own. I learned something—at first, certainly—that hadn ot
been one of the teachings of my small, smothered life; learned tobe amused,
and even amusing, and not to think for the morrow. It was the first time, in
a manner, that I had known space and air and freedom, all the music of
summer and all the mystery of nature. And then there was consideration—and
consideration was sweet. Oh, it was a trap—not designed, but deep—to my
imagination, to my delicacy, perhaps to my vanity; to whatever, in me, was
most excitable. The best way to picture it all is to say that I was off my
guard. They gave me so little trouble—they were of a gentleness so
extraordinary. <font color=teal>I used to speculate—but even this
with a dim disconnectedness—as to how the rough future (for all futures
are rough!) would handle them and might bruise them.</font> They had the
bloom of health and happiness; and yet, as if I had been in charge of a pair
of little grandees, of princes of the blood, for whom everything, to be
right, would have to be enclosed and protected, the only form that, in my
fancy, the after years could take for them was that of a romantic, a really
royal extension of the garden and the park. It may be, of course, above all,
that what suddenly broke into this gives the previous time a charm of
stillness—that hush in which something gathers or crouches. The change was
actually like the spring of a beast.</div><div class=paragraph n=15><sup>¶15</sup>In the <font color=Olive>first weeks</font> the days were long; they often, at their
finest,gave me what I used to call my own hour, the hour when, for my
pupils, teatime and bedtime having come and gone, I had, before my final
retirement, a small interval alone. Much as I liked my companions,
<font color=Olive>this hour</font> was the thing in <font color=Olive>the day</font> I liked
most; and I liked it best of all when, as the light faded—or rather, I
should say, the day lingered and the last calls of the last birds sounded,
in a flushed sky, from the old trees—I could take a turn into the grounds
and enjoy, almost with a sense of property that amused and flattered me, the
beauty and dignity of the place. It was a pleasure at these moments to feel
myself tranquil and justified; doubtless, perhaps, also to reflect that by
my discretion, my quiet good sense and general high propriety, I was giving
pleasure—if he ever thought of it!—to the person to whose pressure I had
responded. What I was doing was what he had earnestly hoped and directly
asked of me, and that I <em>could</em>, after all, do it
proved even a greater joy than I had expected. I daresay I fancied myself,
in short, a remarkable young woman and took comfort in the faith that this
would more publicly appear. Well, I needed to be remarkable to offer a front
to the remarkable things that presently gave their first sign.</div><div class=paragraph n=16><sup>¶16</sup>It was plump, <font color=Olive>one afternoon</font>, in the middle of my very hour: the
children were tucked away, and I had come out for my stroll. One of the
thoughts that, as I don’t in the least shrink now from noting, used to be
with me in these wanderings <font color=lime>was that it
would be as charming as a charming story suddenly to meet someone.
Someone would appear there at the turn of a path and would stand before
me and smile and approve.</font> I didn’t ask more than that—I only
asked that he should <em>know;</em> and the only way to
be sure he knew would be to see it, and the kind light of it, in his
handsome face. That was exactly present to me—by which I mean the face
was—when, on the first of these occasions, at the end of a long <font color=GreenYellow>June</font> day, I stopped short on emerging from one of the
plantations and coming into view of the house. What arrested me on the
spot—<font color=magenta>and with a shock much greater than any
vision had allowed for</font>—was the sense that <font color=magenta>my imagination had, in a flash, turned real.</font> He did stand there!—but high up, beyond the lawn and at the very top
of the tower to which, on that <font color=Olive>first morning</font>, little Flora had conducted me.</div><div class=paragraph n=17><sup>¶17</sup>This tower was one of a pair—square, incongruous, crenelated structures—that
were distinguished, for some reason, though I could see little difference,
as the new and the old. They flanked opposite ends of the house and were
probably architectural absurdities, redeemed in a measure indeed by not
being wholly disengaged nor of a height too pretentious, dating, in their
gingerbread antiquity, <font color=lime>from a romantic
revival that was already a respectable past.</font> I admired them, had
fancies about them, for we could all profit in a degree, especially when
they loomed through the dusk, by the grandeur of their actual battlements;
yet it was not at such an elevation that the figure I had so often invoked
seemed most in place.</div><div class=paragraph n=18><sup>¶18</sup>It produced in me, this figure, in the clear twilight, I remember, two
distinct gasps of emotion, which were, sharply, the shock of my first and
that of my second surprise. My second was a violent perception of the
mistake of my first: the man who met my eyes was not the person I had
precipitately supposed. <font color=magenta>There came to me thus a
bewilderment of vision of which, <font color=GreenYellow>after these years</font>, there
is no living view that I can hope to give.</font> An unknown man in a
lonely place is a permitted object of fear to a young woman privately bred;
and the figure that faced me was—<font color=Olive>a few more seconds</font> assured
me—as little anyone else I knew as it was the image that had been in my
mind. I had not seen it in Harley Street—I had not seen it anywhere. The place, moreover, in the
strangest way in the world, had, on the instant, and by the very fact of its
appearance, become a solitude. To me at least, making my statement here with
a deliberation with which I have never made it, the whole feeling of the
moment returns. It was as if, while I took in—what I did take in—all the
rest of the scene had been stricken with death. <font color=sienna>I
can hear again, as I write, the intense hush in which the sounds of
<font color=Olive>evening</font> dropped. The rooks stopped cawing in the <font color=gold>golden</font> sky, and <font color=Olive>the friendly
hour</font> lost, for the minute, all its voice.</font> But there
was no other change in nature, unless indeed it were a change that I saw
with a stranger sharpness. The <font color=gold>gold</font> was still
in the sky, the clearness in the air, and the man who looked at me over the
battlements was <font color=magenta>as definite as a picture in a
frame.</font> That’s how I thought, with extraordinary quickness, of
each person that he might have been and that he was not. We were confronted
across our distance quite long enough for me to ask myself with intensity
who then he was and to feel, as an effect of my inability to say, a wonder
that in a few instants more became intense.</div><div class=paragraph n=19><sup>¶19</sup>The great question, or one of these, is, afterward, I know, with regard to
certain matters, the question of how long they have lasted. Well, this
matter of mine, think what you will of it, <font color=teal>lasted while I caught at a dozen possibilities,</font> none of which
made a difference for the better, that I could see, in there having been in
the house—and for how long, above all?—a person of whom I was in ignorance.
It lasted while I just bridled a little with the sense that my office
demanded that there should be no such ignorance and no such person. It
lasted while this visitant, at all events—and there was <font color=teal>a touch of the strange freedom,</font> as I
remember, in the sign of familiarity of his wearing no hat—<font color=magenta>
<font color=teal>seemed to fix
me,</font></font> from his position, with just the question, just the
scrutiny through the fading light, that his own presence provoked. <font color=sienna><font color=sienna><font color=magenta>We were too far apart to call to each
other, but there was a moment at which, at shorter range, some
challenge between us, breaking the hush, would have been the
right result of our straight mutual stare.</font></font></font> He
was in one of the angles, the one away from the house, very erect, as it
struck me, and with both hands on the ledge. <font color=magenta>So I
saw him as I see the letters I form on this page;</font> then, exactly,
<font color=Olive>after a minute</font>, as if to add to the spectacle, he slowly
changed his place—passed, <font color=magenta>looking at me hard all
the while,</font> to the opposite corner of the platform. Yes, I had the
sharpest sense that during this transit <font color=magenta>he never
took his eyes from me, and I can see at this moment <font color=teal>the way his hand, as he went, passed from one
of the crenelations to the next.</font></font> He stopped at the other corner, but less long, and even as he turned
away still markedly <font color=magenta>fixed me.</font> He turned
away; that was all I knew.</div></div><div class=chapter n=4><h3>Chapter: 4</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>It was not that I didn’t wait, on this occasion, for more, for I was rooted
as deeply as I was shaken. Was there a “secret” at Bly— <font color=lime>Ann Radcliffe<em>The Mystery of Udolpho</em> a mystery of Udolpho or Charlotte Bronte <em>Jane Eyre</em> an insane, an unmentionable relative kept in unsuspected
confinement?</font> I can’t say how long I turned it over, or how long, in a confusion of
curiosity and dread, I remained where I had had my collision; I only recall
that when I re-entered the house darkness had quite closed in. Agitation, in
the interval, certainly had held me and driven me, for I must, in circling
about the place, have walked three miles; but I was to be, later on, so much
more overwhelmed that this mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human
chill. The most singular part of it, in fact—singular as the rest had
been—was the part I became, in the hall, aware of in meeting Mrs. Grose. <font color=magenta>This
picture comes back to me</font> in the general train—the impression, as
I received it on my return, of the wide white
panelled space, bright in the lamplight and with its portraits and <font color=red>red</font> carpet, and of the good surprised look of my
friend, which immediately told me she had missed me. It came to me
straightway, <font color=teal>under her contact,</font> that, with
plain heartiness, mere relieved anxiety at my appearance, she knew nothing
whatever that could bear upon the incident I had there ready for her. <font color=magenta>I had not suspected in advance that <font color=teal>her comfortable face would pull me up,</font></font> and I somehow measured the importance of what I had seen by my thus
finding myself <font color=lightpink>hesitate to mention it</font>. Scarce
anything in the whole history seems to me so odd as this fact that my real
beginning of fear was one, as I may say, with the instinct of sparing my
companion. On the spot, accordingly, in the pleasant hall <font color=magenta>and with her eyes on me,</font> I, for a reason
that I couldn’t then have phrased, achieved an inward resolution—offered a
vague pretext for my lateness and, with the plea of the beauty of the night
and of the heavy dew and wet feet, went as soon as possible to my room.</div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>Here it was another affair; here, <font color=GreenYellow>for many days after</font>, it was a
queer affair enough. There were hours, from day to day—or at least there
were moments, snatched even from clear duties—when I had to shut myself up
to think. It was not so much yet that I was more nervous than I could bear
to be as that I was remarkably afraid of becoming so; for the truth I had
now to turn over was, simply and clearly, the truth that I could arrive at
no account whatever of the visitor with whom I had been so inexplicably and
yet, as it seemed to me, so intimately concerned. It took little time to see
that I could sound without forms of inquiry and without exciting remark any
domestic complications. The shock I had suffered must have sharpened all my
senses; I felt sure, <font color=GreenYellow>at the end of three days</font> and as the result
of mere closer attention, that I had not been practiced upon by the servants
nor made the object of any “game.” Of whatever it was that I knew, nothing
was known around me. There was but one sane inference: someone had taken a
liberty rather gross. That was what, repeatedly, I dipped into my room and
locked the door to say to myself. We had been, collectively, subject to an
intrusion; some unscrupulous traveler, curious in old houses, had made his
way in unobserved, enjoyed the prospect from the best point of view, and
then stolen out as he came. <font color=magenta>If he had given me
such a bold hard stare, that was but a part of his indiscretion. The
good thing, after all, was that we should surely see no more of him.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup> This was not so good a thing, I admit, as not to leave me to judge that
what, essentially, made nothing else much signify was simply my charming
work. My charming work was just my life with Miles and Flora, and
through nothing could I so like it as through feeling that I could throw
myself into it in trouble. The attraction of my small charges was a constant
joy, leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my original fears, the
distaste I had begun by entertaining for the probable gray prose of my
office. There was to be no gray prose, it appeared, and no long grind; so
how could work not be charming that presented itself as <font color=GreenYellow>daily</font>
beauty? It was all the <font color=lime>romance of the
nursery and the poetry of the schoolroom.</font> I don’t mean by this,
of course, that we studied only fiction and verse; I mean I can express no
otherwise the sort of interest my companions inspired. How can I describe
that except by saying that instead of growing used to them—and it’s a marvel
for a governess: I call the
sisterhood to witness!—I made constant fresh discoveries. There was one
direction, assuredly, in which these discoveries stopped: deep obscurity
continued to cover the region of the boy’s conduct at school. It had been
promptly given me, I have noted, to face that mystery without a pang.
Perhaps even it would be nearer the truth to say that—without a word—he
himself had cleared it up. He had made the whole charge absurd. My
conclusion bloomed there with the real <font color=darkmagenta>rose</font>
flush of his innocence: he was only too fine and fair for the little horrid,
unclean school-world, and he had paid a price for it. I reflected acutely
that the sense of such differences, such superiorities of quality, always,
on the part of the majority—which could include even stupid, sordid
headmasters—turn infallibly to the vindictive.</div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>Both the children had a gentleness (it was their only fault, and it never
made Miles a muff) that kept them—how shall
I express it?—almost impersonal and certainly quite unpunishable. They were
like the cherubs of the anecdote, who had—morally, at any rate—nothing to
whack! I remember feeling with Miles in
especial as if he had had, as it were, no history. We expect of a small
child a scant one, but there was in this beautiful little boy something
extraordinarily sensitive, yet extraordinarily happy, that, more than in any
creature of his age I have seen, struck me as beginning anew <font color=GreenYellow>each
day</font>. He had never <font color=Olive>for a second</font> suffered. I took this
as a direct disproof of his having really been chastised. If he had been
wicked he would have <font color=mistyrose>“caught” it, and I should have
caught it by the rebound</font>—I should have found the trace. I found
nothing at all, and he was therefore an angel. He never spoke of his school,
never mentioned a comrade or a master; and I, for my part, was quite too
much disgusted to allude to them. Of course I was under the spell, and the
wonderful part is that, even at the time, I perfectly knew I was. But I gave
myself up to it; it was an antidote to any pain, and I had more pains than
one. <font color=bisque>I was in receipt in <font color=GreenYellow>these days</font> of
disturbing letters from home,</font> where things were not going well.
But with my children, what things in the world mattered? That was the
question I used to put to my scrappy retirements. I was dazzled by their
loveliness.</div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>There was <font color=GreenYellow>a Sunday</font>—to get on—when it rained with such force and
for so many hours that there could be no procession to church; in
consequence of which, as <font color=GreenYellow>the day</font> declined, I had arranged with
Mrs. Grose that, should <font color=Olive>the
evening</font> show improvement, we would attend together the late
service. The rain happily stopped, and I prepared for our walk, which,
through the park and by the good road to the village, would be a matter of
<font color=Olive>twenty minutes</font>. Coming downstairs to meet my colleague in
the hall, I remembered a pair of gloves that had required three stitches and
that had received them—with a publicity perhaps not edifying—while I sat
with the children at their tea, served on <font color=GreenYellow>Sundays</font>, by
exception, in that cold, clean temple of mahogany and brass, the “grown-up”
dining room. The gloves had been dropped there, and I turned in to recover
them. <font color=GreenYellow>The day</font> was gray enough, but <font color=Olive>the afternoon</font>
light still lingered, and it enabled me, on crossing the threshold, not only
to recognize, on a chair near the wide window, then closed, the articles I
wanted, <font color=magenta>but to become aware of a person on the
other side of the window and looking straight in.</font>
<font color=magenta>One step into the room had sufficed; my vision
was instantaneous; it was all there.</font>
<font color=magenta>The person looking straight in was the person who had
already appeared to me. He appeared thus again with I won’t say greater
distinctness, for that was impossible, but with a nearness that
represented a forward stride in our intercourse and made me, as I met
him, catch my breath and turn cold.</font>
<font color=magenta>He was the same—he was the same, and seen, this
time, as he had been seen before, from the waist up, the window, though
the dining room was on the ground floor, not going down to the terrace
on which he stood.</font>
<font color=magenta>His face was close to the glass, yet the effect
of this better view was, strangely, only to show me how intense the
former had been. He remained but <font color=Olive>a few seconds</font>—long enough
to convince me he also saw and recognized; but it was as if I had been
looking at him for <font color=GreenYellow>years</font> and had known him always.</font>
Something, however, happened this time that had not happened before; <font color=magenta>his stare into my face, through the glass and
across the room, was as deep and hard as then, but it quitted me for a
moment during which I could still watch it, see it fix successively
several other things.</font> On the spot there came to me the added
shock of a certitude that it was not for me he had come there. He had come
for someone else.</div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>The <font color=magenta>flash</font> of this knowledge—for it was knowledge in
the midst of dread—produced in me the most extraordinary effect, started as
I stood there, a sudden vibration of duty and courage. I say courage because
I was beyond all doubt already far gone. I bounded straight out of the door
again, reached that of the house, got, in an instant, upon the drive, and,
passing along the terrace as fast as I could rush, turned a corner and came
full in sight. But it was in sight of nothing now—my visitor had vanished. I
stopped, I almost dropped, with the real relief of this; but I took in the
whole scene—I gave him time to reappear. I call it <font color=Olive>time</font>, but
how long was it? I can’t speak to the purpose <font color=GreenYellow>today</font> of the
duration of these things. That kind of measure must have left me: they
couldn’t have lasted as they actually appeared to me to last. The terrace
and the whole place, the lawn and the garden beyond it, all I could see of
the park, were empty with a great emptiness. There were shrubberies and big
trees, but I remember the clear assurance I felt that none of them concealed
him. He was there or was not there: not there if I didn’t see him. I got
hold of this; then, instinctively, instead of returning as I had come, went
to the window. It was confusedly present to me that I ought to place myself
where he had stood. I did so; <font color=magenta>I applied my face
to the pane and looked, as he had looked,</font> into the room. As if, at
this moment, to show me exactly what his range had been, Mrs. Grose, as I had done for himself just
before, came in from the hall. <font color=magenta>With this I had
the full image</font> of a <font color=mistyrose>repetition of what had
already occurred.</font>
<font color=magenta>She saw me as I had seen my own visitant;</font>
she pulled up short as I had done; I gave her something of the shock that I
had received. She turned white, and this made
me ask myself if I had blanched as much. <font color=magenta>She
stared,</font> in short, and retreated on just <em>my</em> lines, and I knew she had then passed out and come round to me and
that I should presently meet her. I remained where I was, and while I waited
I thought of more things than one. But there’s only one I take space to
mention. I wondered why <em>she</em> should be scared.</div></div><div class=chapter n=5><h3>Chapter: 5</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>Oh, she let me know as soon as, round the corner of the house, <font color=magenta>she loomed again into view.</font>

<font color=Periwinkle><font color=magenta>“You’re as white as a sheet. You look awful.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>I considered; I could meet on this, without scruple, any innocence. My need

dropped, without a rustle, from my shoulders, and if I wavered for the

out my hand to her and she took it; I held her hard a little, liking to
feel her close to me.</font> There was a kind of support in the shy
heave of her surprise. <font color=Indigo>“You came for me for church, of course, but I can’t go.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Has anything

<font color=Indigo>“Well,”</font> I said,
<font color=Indigo>“I’ve been

<font color=magenta>Mrs. Grose’s
eyes expressed plainly that <em>she</em> had no wish
to be,</font> yet also that she knew too well her place not to be ready
to share with me any marked inconvenience. Oh, it was quite settled that she
<em>must</em> share! <font color=Indigo><font color=magenta>“Just what you saw from the dining room a

<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Nobody—nobody.</font>
<font color=mistyrose>I didn’t tell you,</font> but I made sure.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=32><sup>¶32</sup>She breathed a vague relief: this was, oddly, so much to the good. It only
went indeed a little way. <font color=Periwinkle>“But if he isn’t a gentleman—”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=33><sup>¶33</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“What <em>is</em> he? He’s a horror.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=34><sup>¶34</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=mistyrose>“A horror?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=35><sup>¶35</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mediumpurple>“He’s</font>—God help me if I know <em>what</em> he is!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=36><sup>¶36</sup>
<font color=magenta>Mrs. Grose
looked round once more; she fixed her eyes</font> on the duskier
distance, then, pulling herself together, turned to me with abrupt
inconsequence. <font color=Periwinkle>“It’s
time we should be at church.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=37><sup>¶37</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Oh, I’m not fit for
church!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=38><sup>¶38</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Won’t it do you
good?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=39><sup>¶39</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“It won’t do <em>them!</em></font> — I nodded at the house.</div><div class=paragraph n=40><sup>¶40</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“The children?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=41><sup>¶41</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“I can’t leave them
now.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=42><sup>¶42</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=mediumpurple>“You’re afraid—?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=43><sup>¶43</sup>I spoke boldly. <font color=Indigo>“I’m
afraid of <em>him</em>.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=44><sup>¶44</sup>
<font color=magenta>Mrs. Grose’s
large face showed me, at this, for the first time, the faraway faint
glimmer of a consciousness more acute:</font> I somehow made out in it
the delayed dawn of an idea I myself had not given her and that was as yet
quite obscure to me. It comes back to me that I thought instantly of this as
something I could get from her; and I felt it to be connected with the
desire she presently showed to know more. <font color=Periwinkle>“When was it—on the tower?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=45><sup>¶45</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“<font color=GreenYellow>About the middle
of the month</font>. <font color=Olive>At this same hour</font>.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=46><sup>¶46</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Almost at
dark,”</font> said Mrs. Grose.</div><div class=paragraph n=47><sup>¶47</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Oh, no, not nearly. I
<font color=magenta>saw</font> him as I <font color=magenta>see</font>
you.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=48><sup>¶48</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Then how did he get
in?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=49><sup>¶49</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“And how did he get
out?”</font> I laughed. <font color=Indigo>“I had no opportunity to ask him!</font></div><div class=paragraph n=50><sup>¶50</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=Olive>"This
evening</font>, <font color=magenta>you see,”</font></font> I pursued, <font color=Indigo>“he
has not been able to get in.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=51><sup>¶51</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=magenta>“He only peeps?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=52><sup>¶52</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“I hope it will be
confined to that!”</font> She had now let go my
hand; she turned away a little. I waited an instant; then I
brought out: <font color=Indigo>“Go to
church. Goodbye. <font color=magenta>I must watch.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=53><sup>¶53</sup>Slowly she faced me again. <font color=Periwinkle>“Do you fear for them?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=54><sup>¶54</sup>We met in another <font color=magenta>long look.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“Don’t <em>you?</em>”</font> Instead of answering she came
nearer to the window and, <font color=Olive>for a minute</font>, applied her face to the
glass. <font color=Indigo>“You <font color=magenta>see</font> how he could <font color=magenta>see</font>,”</font> I meanwhile went on.</div><div class=paragraph n=55><sup>¶55</sup>She didn’t move. <font color=Periwinkle>“How
long was he here?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=56><sup>¶56</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Till I came out. I
came to meet him.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=57><sup>¶57</sup>Mrs. Grose at last turned round, <font color=magenta>and there was still more in her face.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=58><sup>¶58</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“<em>I</em> couldn’t have come out.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=59><sup>¶59</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Neither could I!”</font></font> I laughed again. <font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“But I did come.</font> I have my duty.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=60><sup>¶60</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“So have I
mine,”</font> she replied; after which she added: <font color=Periwinkle>“What is he like?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=61><sup>¶61</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“I’ve been dying to
tell you. But he’s like nobody.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=62><sup>¶62</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=mistyrose>“Nobody?”</font></font> she <font color=mistyrose>echoed.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=63><sup>¶63</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“He has no hat.”</font>
<font color=magenta>Then seeing in her face that she already, in
this, with a deeper dismay, found a touch of picture, I quickly added
stroke to stroke</font>. <font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“He has <font color=red>red</font> hair, very <font color=red>red</font>,
close-curling, and a pale face, long in shape, with straight, good
features and little, rather queer whiskers that are as <font color=red>red</font> as his hair.</font> His eyebrows are,
somehow, darker; they look particularly arched and as if they might move
a good deal. His eyes are sharp, strange—awfully; but I only know
clearly that they’re rather small and very fixed. His mouth’s wide, and
his lips are thin, and except for his little whiskers he’s quite
clean-shaven. He gives me a sort of sense of looking like an actor.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=64><sup>¶64</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“An actor!”</font>
<font color=magenta>It was impossible to resemble one less, at least,
than Mrs. Grose at that moment.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=65><sup>¶65</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=magenta>“I’ve never seen one,</font> but so I suppose
them. He’s tall, active, erect,”</font> I continued, <font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“but never—no, never!</font>—a gentleman.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=66><sup>¶66</sup>My companion’s face had blanched as I went on; her <font color=magenta>round
eyes</font> started and her mild mouth gaped. <font color=Periwinkle>“A gentleman?”</font> she gasped,
confounded, stupefied: <font color=Periwinkle>“a gentleman <em>he?</em>”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=67><sup>¶67</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“You know him
then?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=68><sup>¶68</sup>She <font color=magenta>visibly</font> tried to hold herself. <font color=Periwinkle>“But he <em>is</em> handsome?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=69><sup>¶69</sup>
<font color=magenta>I saw the way to help her.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“Remarkably!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=70><sup>¶70</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“And dressed—?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=71><sup>¶71</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“In somebody’s
clothes.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=72><sup>¶72</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“They’re smart, but
they’re not his own.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=73><sup>¶73</sup>She broke into a breathless affirmative groan: <font color=Periwinkle>“They’re the master’s!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=74><sup>¶74</sup>
<font color=teal>I caught it up.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“You <em>do</em> know him?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=75><sup>¶75</sup>She faltered but a second. <font color=Periwinkle>“Quint!”</font> she cried.</div><div class=paragraph n=76><sup>¶76</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Quint?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=77><sup>¶77</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Peter Quint—his own man, his valet, when
he was here!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=78><sup>¶78</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“When the master
was?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=79><sup>¶79</sup>Gaping still, but meeting me, she pieced it all together. <font color=Periwinkle>“He never wore his hat,
but he did wear—well, there were waistcoats missed. They were both
here—<font color=GreenYellow>last year</font>. Then the master went, and Quint was
alone.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=80><sup>¶80</sup>
<font color=lightpink>I followed, but halting a little.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“Alone?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=81><sup>¶81</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Alone with <em>us</em>.”</font> Then, as from a deeper depth,
<font color=Periwinkle>“In charge,”</font> she added.</div><div class=paragraph n=82><sup>¶82</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“And what became of
him?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=83><sup>¶83</sup>She <font color=maroon><font color=lightpink>hung fire</font></font> so long that I was
still more mystified. <font color=Periwinkle>“He went, too,”</font> she brought out at last.</div><div class=paragraph n=84><sup>¶84</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Went where?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=85><sup>¶85</sup>
<font color=magenta>Her expression, at this, became
extraordinary.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“God knows where! He
died.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=86><sup>¶86</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Died?”</font> I almost
shrieked.</div><div class=paragraph n=87><sup>¶87</sup>She seemed fairly to square herself, plant herself more firmly to utter the
wonder of it. <font color=Periwinkle>“Yes.
Mr. Quint is dead.”</font></div></div><div class=chapter n=6><h3>Chapter: 6</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>It took of course more than that particular passage to place us together in
presence of what we had now to live with as we could—my dreadful liability
to impressions of the order so vividly exemplified, and my companion’s
knowledge, henceforth—a knowledge half consternation and half compassion—of
that liability. There had been, <font color=Olive>this evening</font>, after the
revelation left me, for <font color=Olive>an hour</font>, so prostrate—there had been,
for either of us, no attendance on any service but a little service of tears
and vows, of prayers and promises, a climax to the series of mutual
challenges and pledges that had straightway ensued on our retreating
together to the schoolroom and shutting ourselves up there to have
everything out. The result of our having everything out was simply to reduce
our situation to the last rigor of its elements. <font color=magenta>She herself had seen nothing, not the shadow of a shadow, and nobody in
the house but the governess was
in the governess’s plight;</font>
yet she accepted without directly impugning my sanity the truth as I gave it
to her, and ended by showing me, on this ground, an awestricken tenderness,
an expression of the sense of my more than questionable privilege, of which
the very breath has remained with me as that of the sweetest of human
charities.</div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>What was settled between us, accordingly, that night, was that we thought we
might bear things together; and I was not even sure that, in spite of her
exemption, it was she who had the best of the burden. I knew <font color=Olive>at this
hour</font>, I think, as well as I knew later, what I was capable of
meeting to shelter my pupils; but it took me some time to be wholly sure of
what my honest ally was prepared for to keep terms with so compromising a
contract. I was queer company enough—quite as queer as the company I
received; but as I trace over what we went through <font color=magenta>I see</font> how much common ground we must have
found in the one idea that, by good fortune, <em>could</em> steady us. It was the idea, the second movement, that led me
straight out, as I may say, of the inner chamber of my dread. I could take
the air in the court, at least, and there Mrs.
Grose could join me. Perfectly can I recall now the
particular way strength came to me before we separated for the night. <font color=magenta>We had gone over and over every feature of what I
had seen.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=magenta>“He was looking for someone else, you
say—someone who was not you?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=magenta>“He was looking for little Miles.”</font></font> A portentous clearness now possessed me. <font color=Indigo><font color=magenta><font color=mistyrose>“<em>That’s</em> whom he
was looking for.”</font></font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“But how do you
know?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“I know, I know, I know!”</font></font> My exaltation grew. <font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“And <em>you</em> know,</font>
my dear!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=7><sup>¶7</sup>She didn’t deny this, but I required, I felt, not even so much telling as
that. She resumed in a moment, at any rate: <font color=Periwinkle><font color=magenta>“What if <em>he</em>
should see him?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=8><sup>¶8</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Little Miles? That’s what he wants!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=9><sup>¶9</sup>
<font color=magenta>She looked immensely scared again.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“The child?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=10><sup>¶10</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Heaven forbid! The
man. He wants to appear to <em>them</em>.”</font>
That he might was an awful conception, and yet, somehow, I could keep it at
bay; which, moreover, as we lingered there, was what I succeeded in
practically proving. <font color=magenta>I had an absolute certainty
that I should see again what I had already seen,</font> but something
within me said that by offering myself bravely as the sole subject of such
experience, by accepting, by inviting, by surmounting it all, I should serve
as an expiatory victim and guard the tranquility of my companions. The
children, in especial, I should thus fence about and absolutely save. I
recall one of the last things I said that night to Mrs. Grose.</div><div class=paragraph n=11><sup>¶11</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“It does strike me that
my pupils have never mentioned—”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=12><sup>¶12</sup>
<font color=magenta>She looked at me hard</font> as I musingly pulled
up. <font color=Indigo>“His having been
here and the time they were with him?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=13><sup>¶13</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“The time they were
with him, and his name, his presence, his history, in any way.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=14><sup>¶14</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Oh, the little lady
doesn’t remember. She never heard or knew.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=15><sup>¶15</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“The circumstances of
his death?”</font> I thought with some intensity.</div><div class=paragraph n=16><sup>¶16</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Perhaps not. But
Miles would remember—Miles would know.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=17><sup>¶17</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Ah, don’t try
him!”</font> broke from Mrs. Grose.</div><div class=paragraph n=18><sup>¶18</sup>
<font color=magenta>I returned her the look she had given me.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“Don’t be afraid.”</font> I continued to think. <font color=Indigo>“It <em>is</em> rather odd.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=19><sup>¶19</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“That he has never
spoken of him?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=20><sup>¶20</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Never by the least
allusion. And you tell me they were ‘great friends’?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=21><sup>¶21</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Oh, it wasn’t <em>him!</em>” </font>Mrs. Grose with emphasis declared. <font color=Periwinkle>“It was Quint’s own
fancy. To play with him, I mean—to spoil him.”</font> She paused a
moment; then she added: <font color=Periwinkle>“Quint was much too free.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=22><sup>¶22</sup>This gave me, straight from my <font color=magenta>vision of his face—<em>such</em> a face!</font> —a sudden sickness of
disgust. <font color=Indigo>“Too free with
<em>my</em> boy?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=23><sup>¶23</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Too free with
everyone!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=24><sup>¶24</sup>I forbore, for the moment, to analyze this description further than by the
reflection that a part of it applied to several of the members of the
household, of the half-dozen maids and men who were still of our small
colony. But there was everything, for our apprehension, in the lucky fact
that no discomfortable legend, no perturbation scullions, had ever, within
anyone’s memory attached to the kind old place. It had neither bad name nor
ill fame, and Mrs. Grose, most
apparently, <font color=teal>only desired to cling to me</font>
and to quake in silence. I even put her, the very last thing of all, to the
test. It was when, <font color=Olive>at midnight</font>, she had her hand on the
schoolroom door to take leave. <font color=Indigo>“I have it from you then—for it’s of great
importance—that he was definitely and admittedly bad?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=25><sup>¶25</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Oh, not admittedly.
<em>I</em> knew it— <font color=lightgreen>but the master didn’t.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=26><sup>¶26</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“And you never told
him?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=27><sup>¶27</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Well, he didn’t like
tale-bearing—he hated complaints. He was terribly short with anything of
that kind, and if people were all right to <em>him</em>—”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=28><sup>¶28</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“He wouldn’t be
bothered with more?”</font> This squared well enough with my impressions
of him: he was not a trouble-loving gentleman, nor so very particular
perhaps about some of the company <em>he</em> kept. All
the same, <font color=teal>I pressed my interlocutress.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“I promise you <em>I</em> would have told!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=29><sup>¶29</sup>She felt my discrimination. <font color=Periwinkle>“I daresay I was wrong. But, really, I was afraid.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=30><sup>¶30</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Afraid</font> of what?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=31><sup>¶31</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Of things that man
could do. Quint was so clever—he was so deep.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=32><sup>¶32</sup>I took this in still more than, probably, I showed. <font color=Periwinkle>“You weren’t afraid of anything else?
Not of his effect—?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=33><sup>¶33</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“ <font color=mistyrose>His effect?”</font></font> she <font color=mistyrose>repeated</font>
<font color=magenta>with a face of anguish</font> and waiting while I
faltered.</div><div class=paragraph n=34><sup>¶34</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“On innocent little
precious lives. They were in your charge.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=35><sup>¶35</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“No, they were not in
mine!”</font> she roundly and distressfully returned.</div><div class=paragraph n=36><sup>¶36</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“The master believed in
him and placed him here because he was supposed not to be well and the
country air so good for him. So he had everything to say.
Yes”</font>—she let me have it— <font color=Periwinkle>“even about <em>them</em>.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=37><sup>¶37</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Them</font>—that creature?”</font> I had to smother a kind of
howl. <font color=Indigo>“And you could
bear it!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=38><sup>¶38</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“No. I couldn’t—and I
can’t now!”</font> And the poor woman burst into tears.</div><div class=paragraph n=39><sup>¶39</sup>A rigid control, <font color=GreenYellow>from the next day</font>, was, as I have said, to
follow them; yet how often and how passionately, <font color=GreenYellow>for a week</font>, we
came back together to the subject! Much as we had discussed it that
<font color=GreenYellow><font color=Olive>Sunday night</font>
</font>, I was, in the immediate
<font color=Olive>later hours</font> in especial—for it may be imagined whether I
slept—still haunted with the shadow of something she had not told me. <font color=antiquewhite>I myself had kept back nothing, but there was a
word Mrs. Grose had kept back.</font> I was sure, moreover, <font color=Olive>by morning</font>, that this was not from
a failure of frankness, but because on every side there were fears. It seems
to me indeed, in retrospect, that by the time the morrow’s sun was high I
had restlessly <font color=lime>read into the fact before us
almost all the meaning they were to receive from subsequent and
morecruel occurrences.</font> What they gave me above all was just the
sinister figure of the living man—the dead one would keep awhile!—and of
<font color=GreenYellow>the months</font> he had continuously passed at Bly, which, added up, made a formidable stretch. The limit of this
evil time had arrived only when, on the dawn of a <font color=GreenYellow>winter’s</font>
<font color=Olive>morning</font>, Peter Quint was
found, by a laborer going to early work, stone dead on the road from the
village: a catastrophe explained—superficially at least—by a visible wound
to his head; such a wound as might have been produced—and as, on the final
evidence, <em>had</em> been—by a fatal slip, in the dark
and after leaving the public house, on the steepish icy slope, a wrong path
altogether, at the bottom of which he lay. The icy slope, the turn mistaken
at night and in liquor, accounted for much—practically, in the end and after
the inquest and boundless chatter, for everything; but there had been
matters in his life—strange passages and perils, secret disorders, vices
more than suspected—that would have accounted for a good deal more.</div><div class=paragraph n=40><sup>¶40</sup>I scarce know how to put my story into words that shall be a credible picture
of my state of mind; but I was in <font color=Olive>these days</font> literally able to
find a joy in the extraordinary flight of heroism the occasion demanded of
me. <font color=magenta>I now saw that I had been asked for a
service admirable and difficult; and there would be a greatness in
letting it be seen</font>—oh, in the right quarter!—that I could succeed
where many another girl might have failed. It was an immense help to me—I
confess I rather applaud myself as I look back!—<font color=magenta>that I saw my service so strongly and so simply.</font> I was there to
protect and defend the little creatures in the world the most bereaved and
the most lovable, the appeal of whose helplessness had suddenly become only
too explicit, a deep, constant ache of one’s own committed heart. We were
cut off, really, together; we were united in our danger. They had nothing
but me, and I—well, I had <em>them</em>. It was in short
a magnificent chance. This chance presented itself to me in an image richly
material. I was a screen—I was to stand before them. <font color=magenta><font color=magenta>The more I saw, the
less they would.</font></font>
<font color=magenta>I began to watch them in a stifled suspense, a
disguised excitement that might well, had it continued too long, have
turned to something like madness.</font> What saved me, <font color=magenta>as I now see,</font> was that it turned to
something else altogether. It didn’t last as suspense—it was superseded by
horrible proofs. Proofs, I say, yes— <font color=teal>from the
moment I really took hold.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=41><sup>¶41</sup>This moment dated from <font color=Olive>an afternoon hour</font> that I happened to
spend in the grounds with the younger of my pupils alone. We had left
Miles indoors, on the <font color=red>red</font> cushion of a deep window seat; <font color=lime>he had wished to finish a book,</font> and I had
been glad to encourage a purpose so laudable in a young man whose only
defect was an occasional excess of the restless. His sister, on the
contrary, had been alert to come out, and I strolled with her <font color=Olive>half an
hour</font>, seeking the shade, for the sun was still high and the day
exceptionally warm. I was aware afresh, with her, as we went, of how, like
her brother, she contrived—it was the charming thing in both children—to let
me alone without appearing to drop me and to accompany me without appearing
to surround. They were never importunate and yet never listless. My
attention to them all really went to seeing them amuse themselves immensely
without me: this was a spectacle they seemed actively to prepare and that
engaged me as an active admirer. <font color=salmon>I walked in a
world of their invention—they had no occasion whatever to draw upon
mine; so that my time was taken only with being, for them, some
remarkable person or thing that the game of the moment required and that
was merely, thanks to my superior, my exalted stamp, a happy and highly
distinguished sinecure. I forget what I was on the present occasion; I
only remember that I was something very important and very quiet and
that Flora was playing very hard. We
were on the edge of the lake, and, as we had lately begun geography, the
lake was the Sea of Azof.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=42><sup>¶42</sup>Suddenly, in these circumstances, I became aware that, on the other side of
the Sea of Azof, we had an interested
spectator. The way this knowledge gathered in me was the strangest thing in
the world—the strangest, that is, except the very much stranger in which it
quickly merged itself. I had sat down with a piece of work—for I was
something or other that could sit—on the old stone bench which overlooked
the pond; and in this position I began to take in with certitude, and yet
<font color=magenta>without direct vision</font>, the presence, at a
distance, of a thin person.</div><div class=paragraph n=43><sup>¶43</sup>The old trees, the thick shrubbery, made a great and pleasant shade, but it
was all suffused with the brightness of the hot, still hour. There was no
ambiguity in anything; none whatever, at least, in the conviction I from one
moment to another found myself forming as to <font color=magenta>what
I should see straight before me and across the lake as a consequence of
raising my eyes.</font> They were attached at this juncture to the
stitching in which I was engaged, and I can feel once more the spasm of my
effort not to move them till I should so have steadied myself as to be able
to make up my mind what to do. There was an alien object in view—a figure
whose right of presence I instantly, passionately questioned. I recollect
counting over perfectly the possibilities, reminding myself that nothing was
more natural, for instance, then the appearance of one of the men about the
place, or even of a messenger, a postman, or a tradesman’s boy, from the
village. That reminder had as little effect on my practical certitude as I
was conscious—still even without looking—of its having upon the character
and attitude of our visitor. Nothing was more natural than that these things
should be the other things that they absolutely were not.</div><div class=paragraph n=44><sup>¶44</sup>Of the positive identity of the apparition I would assure myself as soon as
the small clock of my courage should have ticked out the right second;
meanwhile, with an effort that was already sharp enough, <font color=magenta>I transferred my eyes straight to little Flora,</font> who, at the moment, was about
ten yards away. My heart had stood still for an instant with the wonder and
terror of the question <font color=magenta>whether she too would
see;</font> and I held my breath <font color=sienna>while I waited
for what a cry from her, what some sudden innocent sign either of
interest or of alarm, would tell me.</font> I waited, but nothing came;
then, in the first place—and there is something more dire in this, I feel,
than in anything I have to relate—I was determined by a sense that,
<font color=Olive>within a minute</font>, <font color=sienna>all sounds from
her had previously dropped;</font> and, <font color=Olive>in the second</font>, by
the circumstance that, also <font color=Olive>within the minute</font>, she had, in her
play, turned her back to the water.</div><div class=paragraph n=45><sup>¶45</sup>This was her attitude <font color=magenta>when I at last looked at
her—looked with the confirmed conviction that we were still, together,
under direct personal notice.</font> She had picked up a small flat
piece of wood, which happened to have in it a little hole that had evidently
suggested to her the idea of sticking in another fragment that might figure
as a mast and make the thing a boat. This second morsel, <font color=magenta>as I watched her,</font> she was very markedly and
intently attempting to tighten in its place.</div><div class=paragraph n=46><sup>¶46</sup>My apprehension of what she was doing sustained me so that <font color=Olive>after some
seconds</font> I felt I was ready for more. <font color=magenta>Then I again shifted my eyes—I faced what I had to face.</font></div></div><div class=chapter n=7><h3>Chapter: 7</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>I got hold ofMrs. Grose as soon after this as I
could; and I can give no intelligible account of how I fought out the
interval. Yet I still hear myself cry <font color=teal>as I fairly
threw myself into her arms:</font>
<font color=Indigo>“They <em>know</em>—it’s too monstrous: they know, they
know!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=mediumpurple>“And what on earth—?”</font> I felt her
incredulity as she held me.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Why, all that <em>we</em>
<font color=mistyrose>know—and heaven knows</font> what else besides!”</font> Then, as she released me, I made it out to
her, made it out perhaps only now with full coherency even to myself. <font color=Indigo>“<font color=Olive>Two hours
ago</font>, in the garden”</font>—I could scarce articulate— <font color=Indigo><font color=magenta><font color=magenta>“Flora<em>saw!</em>”</font></font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>Mrs. Grose took it <font color=teal>as she might have taken a blow in the
stomach.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“She has told you?” she
panted.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Not a word—that’s the
horror. She kept it to herself! <font color=mistyrose>The child of
eight, <em>that</em> child!”</font></font> Unutterable still, for me, was the stupefaction of it.</div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>Mrs. Grose, of course, could only gape
the wider. <font color=Periwinkle>“Then how do
you know?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=7><sup>¶7</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=magenta>“I was there—I saw with my eyes: saw that she
was perfectly aware.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=8><sup>¶8</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Do you mean <font color=mistyrose>aware of </font><em>him?</em>”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=9><sup>¶9</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“No—of <em>her</em>.”</font> I was conscious as I spoke that
I <font color=magenta>looked prodigious things,</font> for I got
<font color=magenta>the slow reflection of them in my companion’s
face.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=10><sup>¶10</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Another
person—<font color=Olive>this time</font>; but a figure of quite as unmistakable
horror and evil: a woman in <font color=plum>black</font>, pale
and dreadful—with such an air also, and such a face!—on the other side
of the lake. I was there with the child—quiet for <font color=Olive>the hour</font>;
and in the midst of it she came.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=11><sup>¶11</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=mistyrose>“Came</font> how—from where?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=12><sup>¶12</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“From where they come from!</font> She just
appeared and stood there—but not so near.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=13><sup>¶13</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“And without coming
<font color=mistyrose>nearer?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=14><sup>¶14</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Oh, for the effect and
the feeling, she might have been as close as you!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=15><sup>¶15</sup>My friend, with an odd impulse, fell back a step. <font color=Periwinkle>“Was she someone you’ve never
seen?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=16><sup>¶16</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Yes. But someone the
child has. Someone <em>you</em> have.”</font> Then,
<font color=magenta>to show how I had thought it all out:</font>
<font color=Indigo>“My predecessor—the one
who died.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=17><sup>¶17</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Miss Jessel?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=18><sup>¶18</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Miss
Jessel.</font> You don’t believe me?”</font>
<font color=teal>I pressed.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=19><sup>¶19</sup>She turned right and left in her distress. <font color=Periwinkle>“How can you be sure?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=20><sup>¶20</sup>This drew from me, in the state of my nerves, a <font color=magenta>flash</font> of impatience.</div><div class=paragraph n=21><sup>¶21</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Then ask Flora—<em>she’s</em>
sure!”</font> But I had no sooner spoken than <font color=teal>I caught myself up.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“No, for God’s sake,
<em>don’t!</em> She’ll say she isn’t—she’ll
lie!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=22><sup>¶22</sup>Mrs. Grose was not too bewildered
instinctively to protest. <font color=Periwinkle>“Ah, how <em>can</em> you?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=23><sup>¶23</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Because I’m <font color=magenta>clear</font>. Flora
doesn’t want me to know.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=24><sup>¶24</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“It’s only then to
spare you.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=25><sup>¶25</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“No, no</font>—there are <font color=mistyrose>depths, depths!</font>
<font color=mistyrose>The more I go over it, <font color=magenta>the more
I see in it, and the more I see in it,</font> the more I fear. I
don’t know what I <em>don’t</em> see—what I <em>don’t</em> fear!”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=26><sup>¶26</sup>Mrs. Grose tried to keep up with me.
<font color=Periwinkle>“You mean you’re
afraid of <font color=magenta>seeing her again?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=27><sup>¶27</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Oh, no; that’s
nothing—now!”</font> Then I explained. <font color=Indigo>“It’s of <font color=magenta><em>not</em> seeing her.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=28><sup>¶28</sup>But my companion only <font color=magenta>looked wan.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“I don’t understand
you.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=29><sup>¶29</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Why, it’s that the
child may keep it up—and that the child assuredly <em>will</em>—without my knowing it.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=30><sup>¶30</sup>At the image of this possibility Mrs.
Grose for a moment collapsed, yet presently <font color=teal>to pull herself together again,</font> as if from
the positive force of the sense of what, should we yield an inch, there
would really be to give way to. <font color=Periwinkle><font color=mistyrose>“Dear, dear</font>—we must keep
our heads! And after all, if she doesn’t mind it—!”</font> She even
tried a grim joke. <font color=Periwinkle>“Perhaps she likes it!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=31><sup>¶31</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Likes <em>such</em> things</font> —a scrap of an infant!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=32><sup>¶32</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Isn’t it just a proof
of her blessed innocence?”</font> my friend bravely inquired.</div><div class=paragraph n=33><sup>¶33</sup>She brought me, for the instant, almost round. <font color=Indigo><font color=teal>“Oh, we must clutch at <em>that</em>—we must cling to it!</font> If it isn’t a proof of
what you say, it’s a proof of—God knows what! For the woman’s a horror
of horrors.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=34><sup>¶34</sup>Mrs. Grose, at this, <font color=magenta>fixed her eyes</font>
<font color=Olive>a minute</font> on the ground; then at last raising them, <font color=Periwinkle>“Tell me how you know,”</font> she said.</div><div class=paragraph n=35><sup>¶35</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Then you admit it’s
what she was?”</font> I cried.</div><div class=paragraph n=36><sup>¶36</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=mistyrose>“Tell me how you know,”</font></font>
<font color=mistyrose>my friend simply repeated.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=37><sup>¶37</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Know?</font> By <font color=magenta>seeing</font>
her! By the way she <font color=magenta>looked.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=38><sup>¶38</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“At you, do you mean—so
wickedly?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=39><sup>¶39</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Dear me, no—I could
have borne that. She gave <font color=magenta>me never a glance.</font> She only <font color=magenta>fixed the child.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=40><sup>¶40</sup>
<font color=magenta><font color=magenta>Mrs. Grose tried to see
it.</font></font>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=magenta>“Fixed her?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=41><sup>¶41</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Ah, <font color=magenta>with such awful eyes!”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=42><sup>¶42</sup>She <font color=magenta>stared at mine as if they might really have resembled
them.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Do you mean of
dislike?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=43><sup>¶43</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“God help us, no. Of
something much worse.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=44><sup>¶44</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=mistyrose>“Worse</font> than dislike?”</font> —this left her
indeed at a loss.</div><div class=paragraph n=45><sup>¶45</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“With a
determination—indescribable. <font color=mistyrose>With a</font> kind of
fury of intention.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=46><sup>¶46</sup>I made her <font color=magenta>turn pale.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Intention?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=47><sup>¶47</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“To get hold of her.”</font>Mrs. Grose—her <font color=magenta>eyes</font> just lingering on mine—gave a shudder and walked to the
window; <font color=magenta>and while she stood there looking
out</font> I completed my statement. <font color=Indigo>“<em>That’s</em> what Flora knows.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=48><sup>¶48</sup>After a little she turned round. <font color=Periwinkle>“The person was in <font color=darksalmon>black</font>, you
say?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=49><sup>¶49</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“In mourning—rather
poor, almost shabby. But—yes—with extraordinary beauty.”</font> I now
recognized to what I had at last, stroke by stroke, brought the victim of my
confidence, <font color=magenta>for she quite visibly weighed this.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“Oh, handsome—very,
very,”</font> I insisted; <font color=Indigo>“wonderfully handsome. But infamous.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=50><sup>¶50</sup>She slowly came back to me. <font color=Periwinkle>“Miss
Jessel—<em>was</em> infamous.”</font>
<font color=teal>She once more took my hand in both her own,
holding it as tight as if to fortify me against the increase of alarm I
might draw from this disclosure.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“They were both
infamous,”</font> she finally said.</div><div class=paragraph n=51><sup>¶51</sup>So, for a little, we faced it once more together; and I found absolutely a
degree of help <font color=magenta>in seeing it now so
straight.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“I appreciate,”</font>
I said, <font color=Indigo>“the great
decency of your not having hitherto spoken; but the time has certainly
come to give me the whole thing.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=52><sup>¶52</sup>She appeared to assent to this, but still only in <font color=sienna>silence;</font>
<font color=magenta>seeing which I went on:</font>
<font color=Indigo>“I must have it now. Of
what did she die? Come, there was something between them.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=53><sup>¶53</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“There was
everything.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=54><sup>¶54</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mediumpurple>“In spite of the difference—?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=55><sup>¶55</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Oh, of their rank,
their condition”</font>—she brought it woefully out.</div><div class=paragraph n=56><sup>¶56</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“<em>She</em> was a lady.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=57><sup>¶57</sup>I turned it over; I again <font color=magenta>saw.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Yes—she was a
lady.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=58><sup>¶58</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“And he so dreadfully
below,”</font> said Mrs. Grose.</div><div class=paragraph n=59><sup>¶59</sup>I felt that I doubtless needn’t <font color=teal>press too hard,</font> in such company, on the place of a servant in the scale; but there
was nothing to prevent an acceptance of my companion’s own measure of my
predecessor’s abasement.</div><div class=paragraph n=60><sup>¶60</sup>There was a way to deal with that, and I dealt; the more readily for my <font color=magenta>full vision</font>—on the evidence—of our employer’s late
clever, good-looking “own” man; impudent, assured, spoiled, depraved. <font color=Periwinkle>“The fellow was a
hound.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=61><sup>¶61</sup>Mrs. Grose considered as if it were
perhaps a little a case for a sense of shades. <font color=Periwinkle>“I’ve never seen one like him. He did
what he wished.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=62><sup>¶62</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“With <em>her?</em>”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=63><sup>¶63</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=mistyrose>“With them</font> all.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=64><sup>¶64</sup>
<font color=magenta>It was as if now in my friend’s own eyes
Miss Jessel had again
appeared.</font> I seemed at any rate, for an instant, <font color=magenta><font color=magenta>to see their
evocation of her as distinctly as I had seen her by the
pond;</font></font> and I brought out with decision: <font color=Indigo>“It must have been also what <em>she</em> wished!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=65><sup>¶65</sup>
<font color=magenta><font color=magenta>Mrs. Grose’s face
signified</font></font> that it had been indeed, but she said at the same
time: <font color=Periwinkle>“Poor woman—she
paid for it!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=66><sup>¶66</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Then you do know what
she died of?”</font> I asked.</div><div class=paragraph n=67><sup>¶67</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“No—<font color=mistyrose>I know nothing. I wanted not to know;</font> I was
glad enough I didn’t; and I thanked heaven she was well out of this!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=68><sup>¶68</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Yet you had, then,
your idea—”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=69><sup>¶69</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=mediumpurple>“Of her real reason for leaving?</font> Oh,
yes—as to that. She couldn’t have stayed. Fancy it here—for a governess! And afterward <font color=mistyrose>I imagined—and I still imagine. And what I imagine
is dreadful.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=70><sup>¶70</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Not so dreadful</font> as what <em>I</em> do,”</font> I replied; on which I must have
shown her—as I was indeed but too conscious—a front of miserable defeat. It
brought out again all her compassion for me, and at the renewed <font color=teal>touch of her kindness</font> my power to resist
broke down. I burst, as I had, the other time, made her burst, into tears;
<font color=teal>she took me to her motherly breast</font>, and
my lamentation overflowed. <font color=Indigo>“I don’t do it!”</font> I sobbed in despair; <font color=Indigo>“I don’t save or shield
them! It’s far worse than I dreamed—they’re lost!”</font></div></div><div class=chapter n=8><h3>Chapter: 8</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>What I had said to Mrs. Grose was true
enough: there were in the matter I had put before her depths and
possibilities that I lacked resolution to sound; so that when we met once
more in the wonder of it we were of a common mind about the duty of
resistance to extravagant fancies. We were to keep our heads if we should
keep nothing else—difficult indeed as that might be in the face of what, in
our prodigious experience, was least to be questioned. <font color=Olive>Late that
night</font>, while the house slept, we had another talk in my room,
<font color=magenta>when she went all the way with me as to its
being beyond doubt that I had seen exactly what I had seen.</font>
<font color=teal>To hold her perfectly in the pinch of
that,</font> I found I had only to ask her how, if I had “made it up,” I
came to be able to give, of each of the persons appearing to me, a picture
disclosing, to the last detail, their special marks—a portrait on the
exhibition of which she had instantly recognized and named them. She wished
of course—small blame to her!—to sink the whole subject; and I was quick to
assure her that my own interest in it had now violently taken the form of a
search for the way to escape from it. <font color=mistyrose>I encountered
her on the ground of a probability that with recurrence—for recurrence
we took for granted</font>—I should get used to my danger, distinctly
professing that my personal exposure had suddenly become the least of my
discomforts. It was my new suspicion that was intolerable; and yet even to
this complication <font color=Olive>the later hours of the day</font> had brought a
little ease.</div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>On leaving her, after my first outbreak, I had of course returned to my
pupils, associating the right remedy for my dismay with that sense of their
charm which I had already found to be a thing I could positively cultivate
and which had never failed me yet. I had simply, in other words, plunged
afresh into Flora’s special society and
there become aware—it was almost a luxury!— <font color=teal>that
she could put her little conscious hand straight upon the spot that
ached.</font>
<font color=magenta>She had looked at me in sweet speculation and
then had accused me to my face of having “cried.”</font> I had supposed
I had brushed away the ugly signs: but I could literally—for the time, at
all events—rejoice, under this fathomless charity, that they had not
entirely disappeared. <font color=magenta>To gaze into the depths of
<font color=azure>blue</font> of the child’s eyes</font> and
pronounce their loveliness a trick of premature cunning was to be guilty of
a cynicism in preference to which I naturally preferred to abjure my
judgment and, so far as might be, my agitation. I couldn’t abjure for merely
wanting to, but I could repeat to Mrs.
Grose—as I did there, over and over, in the small
<font color=Olive>hours</font>—that with their voices in the air, their pressure on
one’s heart, and their fragrant faces against one’s cheek, everything fell
to the ground but their incapacity and their beauty. It was a pity that,
somehow, to settle this once for all, I had equally to re-enumerate the
signs of subtlety that, in the afternoon, by the lake had made a miracle of
my show of self-possession. It was a pity to be obliged to reinvestigate the
certitude of the moment itself and repeat how it had come to me as a
revelation that the inconceivable communion I then surprised was a matter,
for either party, of habit. It was a pity that I should have had to quaver
out again the reasons for my not having, in my delusion, so much as
questioned that the little girl <font color=magenta>saw our visitant
even as I actually saw Mrs. Grose
herself, and that she wanted, by just so much as she did thus see, to
make me suppose she didn’t, and at the same time, without showing
anything, arrive at a guess as to whether I myself did!</font> It was a
pity that I needed once more to describe the portentous little activity by
which she sought to divert my attention—the perceptible increase of
movement, the greater intensity of play, the singing, the gabbling of
nonsense, and the invitation to romp.</div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup> Yet if I had not indulged, to prove there was nothing in it, in this review,
I should have missed the two or three dim elements of comfort that still
remained to me. I should not for instance have been able to asseverate to my
friend that I was certain—which was so much to the good—that <em>I</em> at least had not betrayed myself. I should not
have been prompted, by stress of need, by desperation of mind—I scarce know
what to call it—to invoke such further aid to intelligence as might spring
from <font color=teal>pushing my colleague fairly to the wall.</font>
<font color=teal>She had told me, bit by bit, under pressure, a
great deal;</font> but a small shifty spot on the wrong side of it all
still sometimes brushed my brow like the wing of a bat; and I remember how
on this occasion—for the sleeping house and the concentration alike of our
danger and our watch seemed to help—I felt the importance of giving the last
jerk to the curtain. <font color=Indigo>“I
don’t believe anything so horrible,”</font> I recollect saying; <font color=Indigo>“no, let us put it
definitely, my dear, that I don’t. But if I did, you know, there’s a
thing I should require now, just without sparing you the least bit
more—oh, not a scrap, come!—to get out of you. What was it you had in
mind when, in our distress, before Miles came back, <font color=bisque>over the letter from
his school,</font> you said, under my insistence, that you didn’t
pretend for him that he had not literally <em>ever</em> been ‘bad’? He has <em>not</em> literally
‘ever,’ in <font color=GreenYellow>these weeks</font> that I myself have lived with him
and <font color=magenta>so closely watched him;</font> he has been
an imperturbable little prodigy of delightful, lovable goodness.
Therefore you might perfectly have made the claim for him if you had
not, as it happened, <font color=magenta>seen an exception to
take.</font> What was your exception, and to what passage in <font color=magenta><font color=magenta>your personal
observation of him did you refer?”</font></font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>It was a dreadfully austere inquiry, but levity was not our note, and, at any
rate, before the gray dawn admonished us to separate I had got my answer.
What my friend had had in mind proved to be immensely to the purpose. It was
neither more nor less than the circumstance that for a period of
<font color=GreenYellow>several months</font>Quint and the boy had been perpetually
together. It was in fact the very appropriate truth that she had ventured to
criticize the propriety, to hint at the incongruity, of so close an
alliance, and even to go so far on the subject as a frank overture to
Miss Jessel. Miss Jessel had, with a most strange manner,
requested her to mind her business, and the good woman had, on this,
directly approached little Miles. What she
had said to him, <font color=teal>since I pressed,</font> was
that <font color=magenta><em>she</em></font> liked to see young gentlemen not forget their station.</div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>I <font color=teal>pressed</font> again, of course, at this. <font color=Indigo>“You reminded him that
Quint was only a base menial?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“As you might say! And
it was his answer, for one thing, that was bad.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=7><sup>¶7</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“And for another <font color=mistyrose>thing?”</font></font> I waited. <font color=Indigo>“He
<font color=mistyrose>repeated</font> your words to Quint?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=8><sup>¶8</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“No, not that. It’s
just what he <em>wouldn’t!</em>”</font> she could
still impress upon me. <font color=Periwinkle>“I was sure, at any rate,”</font> she added, <font color=Periwinkle>“that he didn’t. But he denied certain
occasions.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=9><sup>¶9</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“What
occasions?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=10><sup>¶10</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“When they had been
about together quite as if Quint
were his tutor—and a very grand one—and Miss
Jessel only for the little lady. When he had gone off
with the fellow, I mean, and spent <font color=Olive>hours</font> with him.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=11><sup>¶11</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“He then prevaricated
about it—he said he hadn’t?”</font> Her assent was clear enough to
cause me to add in a moment: <font color=Indigo>“I <font color=magenta>see</font>. He lied.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=12><sup>¶12</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Oh!”</font>Mrs. Grose mumbled. This was a suggestion that it
didn’t matter; which indeed she backed up by a further remark. <font color=Periwinkle>“You see, after all,
Miss Jessel didn’t mind. She
didn’t forbid him.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=13><sup>¶13</sup>I considered. <font color=Indigo>“Did he
put that to you as a justification?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=14><sup>¶14</sup>At this she dropped again. <font color=Periwinkle>“No, he never spoke of it.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=15><sup>¶15</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Never mentioned her in
connection with Quint?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=16><sup>¶16</sup>She saw, <font color=magenta>visibly flushing</font>, where I was
coming out. <font color=Periwinkle>“Well, he
didn’t show anything. He denied,”</font> she <font color=mistyrose>repeated; <font color=Periwinkle>“he
denied.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=17><sup>¶17</sup>Lord, how I <font color=teal>pressed her</font> now! <font color=Indigo><font color=magenta>“So that you could see he knew what was
between the two wretches?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=18><sup>¶18</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=mistyrose>“I don’t know—I don’t know!”</font></font> the poor woman groaned.</div><div class=paragraph n=19><sup>¶19</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“You do know, you dear
thing,”</font> I replied; <font color=Indigo>“only you haven’t my dreadful boldness of mind, and
you keep back, out of timidity and modesty and delicacy, even the
impression that, in the past, when you had, without my aid, to flounder
about in silence, most of all made you miserable. But I shall get it out
of you yet! There was something in the boy that suggested to you,”</font> I continued, <font color=Indigo>“that he covered and concealed their relation.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=20><sup>¶20</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=mediumpurple>“Oh, he couldn’t prevent—”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=21><sup>¶21</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Your learning the
truth? I daresay! But, heavens,”</font> I fell, with vehemence,
athinking, <font color=Indigo>“what it
shows that they must, to that extent, have succeeded in making of him!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=22><sup>¶22</sup>“Ah, nothing that’s not nice <em>now!</em>” Mrs. Grose lugubriously pleaded.</div><div class=paragraph n=23><sup>¶23</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“I don’t wonder <font color=magenta>you looked queer,”</font></font> I persisted, <font color=Indigo><font color=bisque>“when I mentioned to you the letter from his
school!”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=24><sup>¶24</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=magenta>“I doubt if I looked as queer as you!”</font></font> she retorted with homely force.</div><div class=paragraph n=25><sup>¶25</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“And if he was so bad
then as that comes to, how is he such an angel now?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=26><sup>¶26</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Yes, indeed—and if he
was a fiend at school! <font color=mistyrose>How, how, how?</font>
Well,”</font> I said in my torment, <font color=Indigo>“ <font color=mistyrose>you must put it to me again,
but I shall not be able to tell you <font color=GreenYellow>for some days</font>.
Only, put it to me again!”</font></font>
<font color=magenta>I cried in a way that made my friend stare.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“There are directions
in which I must not for the present let myself go.”</font> Meanwhile I
returned to her first example—the one to which she had just previously
referred—of the boy’s happy capacity for an occasional slip. <font color=Indigo>“If Quint—on your remonstrance at the time
you speak of—was a base menial, one of the things Miles said to you, I find myself guessing, was that you
were another.”</font> Again her admission was so adequate that I
continued: <font color=Indigo>“And you
forgave him that?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=27><sup>¶27</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Wouldn’t <em>you?</em>”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=28><sup>¶28</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Oh, yes!”</font>
<font color=sienna>And we exchanged there, in the stillness, a sound
of the oddest amusement.</font> Then I went on: <font color=Indigo>“At all events, while he was with the
man—”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=29><sup>¶29</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Miss Flora was with the woman. It suited them
all!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=30><sup>¶30</sup>It suited me, too, I felt, only too well; by which I mean that it suited
exactly the particularly deadly view I was in the very act of forbidding
myself to entertain. But I so far succeeded in checking the expression of
this view that I will throw, just here, no further light on it than may be
offered by the mention of my final observation to Mrs. Grose. <font color=Indigo>“His having lied and been impudent are, I confess,
less engaging specimens than I had hoped to have from you of the
outbreak in him of the little natural man. Still,”</font> I mused,
<font color=Indigo>“They must do, for
they make me feel more than ever <font color=magenta>that I must
watch.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=31><sup>¶31</sup>It made me blush, <font color=GreenYellow>the next minute</font>, <font color=magenta>to
see in my friend’s face</font> how much more unreservedly she had
forgiven him than her anecdote struck me as presenting to my own tenderness
an occasion for doing. This came out when, at the schoolroom door, she
quitted me. <font color=Periwinkle><font color=mediumpurple>“Surely you don’t accuse <em>him</em>—”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=32><sup>¶32</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Of carrying on an
intercourse that he conceals from me? Ah, remember that, until further
evidence, I now <font color=mistyrose>accuse</font> nobody.”</font>
Then, before shutting her out to go, by another passage, to her own place,
<font color=Indigo>“I must just
wait,”</font> I wound up.</div></div><div class=chapter n=9><h3>Chapter: 9</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>
<font color=mistyrose>I waited and waited,</font> and <font color=GreenYellow>the days</font>,
as they elapsed, took something from my consternation. A very few of them,
in fact, passing, <font color=magenta>in constant sight of my
pupils,</font> without a fresh incident, sufficed to give to grievous
fancies and even to odious memories a kind of brush of the sponge. I have
spoken of the surrender to their extraordinary childish grace as a thing I
could actively cultivate, and it may be imagined if I neglected now to
address myself to this source for whatever it would yield. Stranger than I
can express, certainly, was the effort to struggle against my new lights; it
would doubtless have been, however, a greater tension still had it not been
so frequently successful. I used to wonder how my little charges could help
guessing that I thought strange things about them; and the circumstances
that these things only made them more interesting was not by itself a direct
aid to keeping them in the dark. <font color=magenta>I trembled
lest they should see that they <em>were</em> so
immensely more interesting.</font> Putting things at the worst, at all
events, as in meditation I so often did, any clouding of their innocence
could only be—blameless and foredoomed as they were—a reason the more for
taking risks. There were moments when, by an irresistible impulse, <font color=teal>I found myself catching them up and pressing them
to my heart.</font> As soon as I had done so I used to say to myself:
<font color=Indigo>“What will they
think of that? Doesn’t it betray too much?”</font> It would have been
easy to get into a sad, wild tangle about how much I might betray; but the
real account, I feel, of the hours of peace that I could still enjoy was
that the immediate charm of my companions was a beguilement still effective
even under the shadow of the possibility that it was studied. For if it
occurred to me that I might occasionally excite suspicion by the little
outbreaks of my sharper passion for them, <font color=magenta>so too
I remember wondering if I mightn’t see a queerness in the traceable
increase of their own demonstrations.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>They were at this period extravagantly and preternaturally fond of me; which,
after all, I could reflect, was no more than a graceful response in children
perpetually bowed over and hugged. The homage of which they were so lavish
succeeded, in truth, for my nerves, quite as well as if I never appeared to
myself, as I may say, <font color=teal>literally to catch them at
a purpose in it.</font> They had never, I think, wanted to do so many
things for their poor protectress; I mean—though they got their lessons
better and better, which was naturally what would please her most—in the way
of diverting, entertaining, surprising her; reading her passages, telling
her stories, acting her charades, pouncing out at her, in disguises, as
animals and historical characters, and above all astonishing her by the
“pieces” they had secretly got by heart and could interminably recite. I
should never get to the bottom—were I to let myself go even now—of the
prodigious private commentary, all under still more private correction, with
which, in <font color=GreenYellow>these days</font>, I overscored <font color=Olive>their full
hours</font>. <font color=magenta><font color=magenta>They had shown me</font></font> from the first a facility for
everything, a general faculty which, taking a fresh start, achieved
remarkable flights. They got their little tasks as if they loved them, and
indulged, from the mere exuberance of the gift, in the most unimposed little
miracles of memory. They not only popped out at me as tigers and as Romans,
but as Shakespeareans, astronomers, and navigators. This was so singularly
the case that it had presumably much to do with the fact as to which, at
<font color=GreenYellow>the present day</font>, I am at a loss for a different
explanation: I allude to my unnatural composure on the subject of another
school for Miles. What I remember is that I
was content not, for the time, to open the question, and that contentment
must have sprung from the sense of his perpetually striking show of
cleverness. He was too clever for a bad governess, for a parson’s daughter, to spoil; and the strangest if
not the brightest thread in the pensive embroidery I just spoke of was the
impression I might have got, if I had dared to work it out, that hew asunder
some influence operating in his small intellectual life as a tremendous
incitement.</div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>If it was easy to reflect, however, that such a boy could postpone school, it
was at least as marked that for such a boy to have been “kicked out” by a
schoolmaster was a mystification without end. Let me add that in their
company now—and I was careful almost never to be out of it—<font color=Peru>I could follow no scent very far.</font> We lived
in a cloud of music and love and success and private theatricals. The
musical sense in each of the children was of the quickest, <font color=mistyrose>but the elder in especial had a marvelous knack of
catching and repeating.</font> The schoolroom piano broke into all
gruesome fancies; and when that failed there were confabulations in corners,
with a sequel of one of them going out in the highest spirits in order to
“come in” as something new. I had had brothers myself, and it was no
revelation to me that little girls could be slavish idolaters of little
boys. What surpassed everything was that there was a little boy in the world
who could have for the inferior age, sex, and intelligence so fine a
consideration. They were extraordinarily at one, and to say that they never
either quarreled or complained is to make the note of praise coarse for
their quality of sweetness. Sometimes, indeed, when I dropped into
coarseness, I perhaps came across traces of little understandings between
them by which one of them should keep me occupied while the other slipped
away. There is a <em>naïf</em> side, I suppose, in all
diplomacy; but if my pupils practiced upon me, it was surely with the
minimum of grossness. It was all in the other quarter that, after a lull,
the grossness broke out.</div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>
<font color=lightpink>I find that I really hang back; but I must take my
plunge.</font> In going on with the record of what was hideous at
Bly, I not only challenge the most liberal faith—for which I little
care; but—and this is another matter—I renew what I myself suffered, I again
push my way through it to the end. There came suddenly <font color=Olive>an hour</font>
after which, as I look back, the affair seems to me to have been all pure
suffering; but I have at least reached the heart of it, and the straightest
road out is doubtless to advance. One <font color=Olive>evening</font>—with nothing to
lead up or to prepare it—<font color=teal>I felt the cold touch
of the impression that had breathed on me</font> the night of my arrival
and which, much lighter then, as I have mentioned, I should probably have
made little of in memory had my subsequent sojourn been less agitated. <font color=lime>I had not gone to bed; I sat reading by a
couple of candles. There was a roomful of old books at Bly—<font color=GreenYellow>last-century
fiction</font>, some of it, which, to the extent of a distinctly
deprecated renown, but never to so much as that of a stray specimen, had
reached the sequestered home and appealed to the unavowed curiosity of
my youth. I remember that the book I had in my hand</font> was Fielding’s<em>Amelia</em> ; also that I was wholly awake. I recall further both a general
conviction that it was horribly late <font color=magenta>and a
particular objection to looking at my watch.</font> I figure, finally,
that the white curtain draping, in the fashion
of <font color=GreenYellow>those days</font>, the head of Flora’s little bed, shrouded, as I had assured myself long
before, the perfection of childish rest. I recollect in short that, though I
was deeply interested in my author, I found myself, at the turn of a page
and with his spell all scattered, <font color=magenta>looking straight up from
him and hard at the door of my room.</font> There was a moment during
which I listened, reminded of the faint sense I had had, the first night, of
there being something undefinably astir in the house, and noted the soft
breath of the open casement just move the half-drawn blind. Then, with all
the marks of a deliberation that must have seemed magnificent had there been
anyone to admire it, <font color=lime>I laid down my
book,</font> rose to my feet, and, taking a candle, went straight out of
the room and, from the passage, on which my light made little impression,
noiselessly closed and locked the door.</div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>I can say now neither what determined nor what guided me, but I went straight
along the lobby, holding my candle high, <font color=magenta>till I
came within sight of the tall window that presided over the great turn
of the staircase.</font> At this point I precipitately found myself
aware of three things. They were practically simultaneous, yet they had
flashes of succession. My candle, under a bold flourish, went out, and I
perceived, by the uncovered window, that the yielding dusk of <font color=Olive>earliest
morning</font> rendered it unnecessary. Without it, the next instant,
<font color=magenta>I saw that there was someone on the stair.</font> I speak of sequences, but I required <font color=Olive>no lapse of seconds</font>
to stiffen myself for a third encounter with Quint. The apparition had reached the landing halfway up and
was therefore on the spot nearest the window, <font color=magenta>where at sight of me, it stopped short and fixed me exactly as it had
fixed me from the tower and from the garden.</font>
<font color=mistyrose>:He knew me as well as I knew him;</font> and so, in
the cold, faint twilight, with a glimmer in the high glass and another on
the polish of the oak stair below, we faced each other in our common
intensity. He was absolutely, on this occasion, a living, detestable,
dangerous presence. But that was not the wonder of wonders; I reserve this
distinction for quite another circumstance: the circumstance that dread had
unmistakably quitted me and that there was nothing in me there that didn’t
meet and measure him.</div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>I had plenty of anguish after that extraordinary moment, but I had, thank
God, no terror. And he knew I had not—I found myself at the end of an
instant magnificently aware of this. I felt, in a fierce rigor of
confidence, that if I stood my ground a minute I should cease—for the time,
at least—to have him to reckon with; and during <font color=Olive>the minute</font>,
accordingly, the thing was as human and hideous as a real interview: hideous
just because it <em>was</em> human, as human as to have
met alone, in <font color=Olive>the small hours</font>, in a sleeping house, some enemy,
some adventurer, some criminal. <font color=sienna><font color=magenta>It was the dead silence of our long
gaze</font></font> at such close quarters that gave the whole horror, huge
as it was, its only note of the unnatural. If I had met a murderer in such a
place and at <font color=Olive>such an hour</font>, we still at least would have spoken.
Something would have passed,in life, between us; if nothing had passed, one
of us would have moved.</div><div class=paragraph n=7><sup>¶7</sup>The moment was so prolonged that it would have taken but little more to make
me doubt if even <em>I</em> were in life. I can’t express
what followed it save by saying that <font color=sienna>the silence
itself</font>—which was indeed in a manner an attestation of my
strength—became the element into which <font color=magenta>I saw
the figure disappear;</font> in which <font color=magenta>:I
definitely saw it turn as I might have seen the low wretch to which it
had once belonged turn on receipt of anorder, and pass, with my eyes on
the villainous back that no hunch could have more disfigured, straight
down the staircase and into the darkness in which the next bend was
lost.</font></div></div><div class=chapter n=10><h3>Chapter: 10</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>I remained awhile at the top of the stair, but with the effect presently of
understanding that when my visitor had gone, he had gone: then I returned to
my room. <font color=magenta>The foremost thing I saw there by the
light of the candle I had left burning was that Flora’s little bed was empty;</font> and on this I
caught my breath with all the terror that, <font color=Olive>five minutes before</font>,
I had been able to resist. I dashed at the place in which I had left her
lying and over which (for the small silk counterpane and the sheets were
disarranged) the white curtains had been
deceivingly pulled forward; then my step, to my unutterable relief, <font color=sienna>produced an answering sound:</font>
<font color=magenta>I perceived an agitation of the window
blind,</font> and the child, ducking down, emerged rosily from the other
side of it. She stood there in so much of her candor and so little of her
nightgown, with her <font color=pink>pink</font> bare feet and the <font color=gold>golden</font> glow of her curls. <font color=magenta>She looked intensely grave,</font> and I had never
had such a sense of losing an advantage acquired (the thrill of which had
just been so prodigious) as on my consciousness that she addressed me with a
reproach. <font color=Indigo>“You naughty:
where <em>have</em> you been?”</font> —instead of
challenging her own irregularity I found myself arraigned and explaining.
She herself explained, for that matter, with the loveliest, eagerest
simplicity. She had known suddenly, as she lay there, that I was out of the
room, <font color=magenta>and had jumped up to see what had become of
me.</font> I had dropped, with the joy of her reappearance, back into my
chair—feeling then, and then only, a little faint; <font color=teal>and she had pattered straight over to me, thrown herself upon my knee,
given herself to be held with the flame of the candle full in the
wonderful little face that was still flushed with sleep.</font>
<font color=magenta>I remember closing my eyes an instant,
yieldingly, consciously, as before the excess of something beautiful
that shone out of the <font color=azure>blue</font> of her own.</font>
<font color=Indigo><font color=magenta>“You were looking for me out of the
window?”</font></font> I said. <font color=Indigo>“You
thought I might be walking in the grounds?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>
<font color=Green>“Well, you know, I thought
someone was”</font>—she never blanched as she smiled out that at me.</div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>
<font color=magenta>Oh, how I looked at her now!</font>
<font color=Indigo>“And did you see
anyone?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>
<font color=Green>“Ah, <em>no!</em>”</font> she returned, almost with the full privilege of
childish inconsequence, resentfully, though with a long sweetness in her
little drawl of the negative.</div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>At that moment, in the state of my nerves, I absolutely believed she lied;
<font color=magenta>and if I once more closed my eyes it was
before the dazzle of the three or four possible ways in which I might
take this up.</font> One of these, for a moment, tempted me with such
singular intensity that, to withstand it, <font color=teal>I must
have gripped my little girl with a spasm that, wonderfully, she
submitted to without a cry or a sign of fright.</font> Why not break out
at her on the spot and have it all over?—give it to her straight in her
lovely little <font color=magenta>lighted</font> face? <font color=Indigo><font color=magenta>“You see, you see,</font> you <em>know</em> that you do and that you already quite
suspect I believe it; therefore, why not frankly confess it to me, so
that we may at least live with it together and learn perhaps, in the
strangeness of our fate, where we are and what it means?”</font> This
solicitation dropped, alas, as it came: if I could immediately have
succumbed to it I might have spared myself—<font color=magenta>well, you’ll see what.</font> Instead of succumbing I sprang again to my
feet, <font color=magenta>looked at her bed,</font> and took a
helpless middle way.</div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Why did you pull the
curtain over the place to make me think you were still there?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=7><sup>¶7</sup>Flora<font color=magenta>luminously considered</font>; after which, with
her little divine smile: <font color=Green>“Because I don’t like to frighten you!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=8><sup>¶8</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“But if I had, by your
idea, gone out—?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=9><sup>¶9</sup>She absolutely declined to be puzzled; she <font color=magenta>turned
her eyes</font> to the <font color=maroon>flame of the candle</font> as if
the question were as irrelevant, or at any rate as impersonal, as Mrs.
Marcet or nine-times-nine. <font color=Green>“Oh, but you know,”</font> she quite adequately answered, <font color=Green>“that you might come back,
you dear, and that you <em>have!</em>”</font> And
after a little, when she had got into bed, I had, for a long time,<font color=teal>by almost sitting on her to hold her hand,</font>
to prove that I recognized the pertinence of my return.</div><div class=paragraph n=10><sup>¶10</sup>You may imagine the general complexion, from that moment, of <font color=GreenYellow>my
nights</font>. I <font color=mistyrose>repeatedly</font> sat up till I
didn’t know when; I selected moments when my roommate unmistakably slept,
and, stealing out, took noiseless turns in the passage and even pushed as
far as to where I had last met Quint.</div><div class=paragraph n=11><sup>¶11</sup>But I never met him there again; and I may as well say at once that I on no
other occasion <font color=magenta>saw him in the house.</font> I just
missed, on the staircase, on the other hand, a different adventure. <font color=magenta>Looking down it from the top I once recognized the
presence of a woman seated on one of the lower steps with her back
presented to me, her body half-bowed and her head, in an attitude of
woe, in her hands.</font> I had been there but an instant, however, <font color=magenta>when she vanished without looking round at me.</font>
<font color=magenta>I knew, nonetheless, exactly what dreadful face
she had to show;</font> and I wondered whether, if instead of being above
I had been below, I should have had, for going up, the same nerve I had
lately shown Quint. Well, there
continued to be plenty of chance for nerve. On the eleventh night after my
latest encounter with that gentleman—they were all numbered now—I had an
alarm that perilously skirted it and that indeed, from the particular
quality of its unexpectedness, proved quite my sharpest shock. It was
precisely the first night during this series that, weary with watching, I
had felt that I might again without laxity lay myself down at <font color=Olive>my old
hour</font>. I slept immediately and, as I afterward knew, till about
one o’clock; but when I woke it was to sit straight up, as completely roused
<font color=teal>as if a hand had shook me.</font>
<font color=maroon>I had left a light burning, but it was now out, and I felt
an instant certainty that Flora had
extinguished it.</font> This brought me to my feet and straight, in the
darkness, to her bed, which I found she had left. <font color=magenta>A glance at the window enlightened me further, and the striking of a
match completed the picture.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=12><sup>¶12</sup>The child had again got up— <font color=maroon>this time blowing out the taper,</font>
<font color=magenta>and had again, for some purpose of observation or
response, squeezed in behind the blind and was peering out into the
night.</font>
<font color=magenta>That she now saw—as she had not, I had satisfied
myself, the previous time—was proved to me by the fact that she was
disturbed neither by my reillumination nor by the haste I made to get
into slippers and into a wrap.</font> Hidden, protected, absorbed, she
evidently rested on the sill—the casement opened forward—and gave herself
up. There was a great still moon to help her, and this fact had counted in
my quick decision. <font color=magenta>She was face to face with the
apparition we had met at the lake, and could now communicate with it as
she had not then been able to do.</font> What I, on my side, had to care
for was, without disturbing her, to reach, from the corridor, some other
window in the same quarter. <font color=sienna>I got to the door
without her hearing me;</font> I got out of it, closed it, and listened,
from the other side, for some sound from her. While I stood in the passage
<font color=magenta>I had my eyes on her brother’s door,</font>
which was but ten steps off and which, indescribably, produced in me a
renewal of the strange impulse that I lately spoke of as my temptation. What
if I should go straight in and march to <em>his</em>
window?—what if, by risking to his boyish bewilderment a revelation of my
motive, I should throw across the rest of the mystery the long halter of my
boldness?</div><div class=paragraph n=13><sup>¶13</sup>This thought <font color=teal>held me sufficiently</font> to make
me cross to his threshold and pause again. I preternaturally listened; I
figured to myself what might portentously be; I wondered if his bed were
also empty and <font color=magenta>he too were secretly at watch.</font>
<font color=sienna>It was a deep, soundless minute,</font> at the end
of which my impulse failed. <font color=sienna>He was quiet; he might
be innocent;</font> the risk was hideous; I turned away. There was a
figure in the grounds—<font color=magenta>a figure prowling for a
sight,</font> the visitor with whom Flora was engaged; but it was not the visitor most concerned
with my boy. <font color=lightpink>I hesitated afresh, but on other grounds and
only for <font color=Olive>a few seconds</font>; then I had made my choice.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=14><sup>¶14</sup>There were empty rooms at Bly, and it was only a question of choosing the right one. The
right one suddenly presented itself to me as the lower one—though high above
the gardens—in the solid corner of the house that I have spoken of as the
old tower. This was a large, square chamber, arranged with some state as a
bedroom, the extravagant size of which made it so inconvenient that it had
not for <font color=GreenYellow>years</font>, though kept by Mrs.
Grose in exemplary order, been occupied. I had often admired
it and I knew my way about in it; I had only, after just faltering at the
first chill gloom of its disuse, to pass across it <font color=sienna>and unbolt as quietly as I could one of the shutters.</font>
<font color=sienna>Achieving this transit, I uncovered the glass
without a sound</font> and, applying my face to the pane, was able, <font color=magenta>the darkness without being much less than within,
to see that I commanded the right direction. Then I saw something more.
The moon made the night extraordinarily penetrable and showed me on the
lawn a person, diminished by distance, who stood there motionless and as
if fascinated, looking up to where I had appeared—looking, that is, not
so much straight at me as at something that was apparently above
me.</font> There was clearly another person above me—there was a person
on the tower; but the presence on the lawn was not in the least what I had
conceived and had confidently hurried to meet. The presence on the lawn—I
felt sick as I made it out—was poor little Miles himself.</div></div><div class=chapter n=11><h3>Chapter: 11</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>It was not till <font color=GreenYellow>late next day</font> that I spoke to Mrs. Grose; <font color=magenta>the
rigor with which I kept my pupils in sight</font> making it often
difficult to meet her privately, and the more as we each felt the importance
of not provoking—on the part of the servants quite as much as on that of the
children—any suspicion of a secret flurry or that of a discussion of
mysteries. <font color=magenta>I drew a great security in this
particular from her mere smooth aspect. There was nothing in her fresh
face to pass on to others my horrible confidences.</font> She believed
me, I was sure, absolutely: if she hadn’t I don’t know what would have
become of me, for I couldn’t have borne the business alone. But she was a
magnificent monument to the blessing of a want of imagination, <font color=magenta>and if she could see in our little charges</font>
nothing but their beauty and amiability, their happiness and cleverness, she
had no direct communication with the sources of my trouble. <font color=magenta>If they had been at all visibly blighted or
battered,</font> she would doubtless have grown, on tracing it back,
haggard enough to match them; as matters stood, however, I could feel her,
<font color=magenta>when she surveyed them,</font> with her large
white arms folded <font color=magenta>and the habit of serenity in all her look,</font>
thank the Lord’s mercy that if they were ruined the pieces would still
serve. Flights of fancy gave place, in her mind, <font color=maroon>to a steady
fireside glow,</font> and I had already begun to perceive how, with the
development of the conviction that—as time went on without a public
accident—our young things could, after all, look out for themselves, she
addressed her greatest solicitude to the sad case presented by their
instructress. That, for myself, was a sound simplification: I could engage
that, to the world, <font color=magenta>my face should tell no
tales,</font> but it would have been, in the conditions, an immense added
strain to find myself anxious about hers.</div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>
<font color=Olive>At the hour</font> I now speak of she had joined me, under pressure, on
the terrace, where, with the lapse of the <font color=GreenYellow>season</font>,
the afternoon sun was now agreeable; and we sat there together while, before
us, at a distance, but within call if we wished, the children strolled to
and fro in one of their most manageable moods. They moved slowly, in unison,
below us, over the lawn, the boy, as they went, <font color=lime>reading aloud from a storybook</font> and <font color=teal>passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in touch.</font>
<font color=magenta>Mrs. Grose
watched them with positive placidity;</font> then I caught the <font color=sienna>suppressed intellectual creak with which she
conscientiously turned to take from me a view of the back of the
tapestry.</font> I had made her a receptacle of lurid things, but there
was an odd recognition of my superiority—my accomplishments and my
function—in her patience under my pain. She offred her mind to my
disclosures as, had I wished to mix a witch’s broth and proposed it with
assurance, she would have held out a large clean saucepan. This had become
thoroughly her attitude by the time that, in my recital of the events of
<font color=Olive>the night</font>, I reached the point of what Miles had said to me when, <font color=magenta>after seeing him, at such a monstrous hour, almost
on the very spot where he happened now to be,</font> I had gone down to
bring him in; choosing then, at the window, with a concentrated need of not
alarming the house, rather that method than a signal more resonant. I had
left her meanwhile in little doubt of my small hope of representing with
success even to her actual sympathy my sense of the real splendor of the
little inspiration with which, after I had got him into the house, the boy
met my final articulate challenge. <font color=magenta>As soon as I
appeared in the moonlight on the terrace, he had come to me as straight
as possible;</font>
<font color=teal>on which I had taken his hand without a word and
led him, through the dark spaces, up the staircase where Quint had so hungrily hovered for him,</font> along the lobby <font color=sienna>where I had listened and
trembled, and so to his forsaken room.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>
<font color=sienna>Not a sound, on the way, had passed between
us,</font> and I had wondered—oh, <em>how</em> I had
wondered!—<font color=teal>if he were groping about in his
little mind for something plausible and not too grotesque.</font> It
would tax his invention, certainly, and I felt, this time, over his real
embarrassment, a curious thrill of triumph. It was a sharp trap for the
inscrutable! He couldn’t play any longer at innocence; so how the deuce
would he get out of it? There beat in me indeed, with the passionate throb
of this question an equal dumb appeal as to how the deuce <em>I</em> should. I was confronted at last, as never yet,
with all the risk attached even now to sounding my own horrid note. I
remember in fact that as we pushed into his little chamber, where the bed
had not been slept in at all and the window, uncovered to the moonlight,
made the place so clear that there was no need of striking a match—I
remember how I suddenly dropped, sank upon the edge of the bed from the
force of the idea that he must know how he really, as they say, “had” me. He
could do what he liked, with all his cleverness to help him, so long as I
should continue to defer to the old tradition of the criminality of those
caretakers of the young who minister to superstitions and fears. He “had” me
indeed, and in a cleft stick; for who would ever absolve me, who would
consent that I should go unhung, if, by the faintest tremor of an overture,
I were the first to introduce into our perfect intercourse an element so
dire? No, no: it was useless to attempt to convey to Mrs. Grose, just as it is scarcely less so to
attempt to suggest here, <font color=teal>how, in our short, stiff
brush in the dark, he fairly shook me with admiration.</font> I was of
course thoroughly kind and merciful; <font color=teal>never, never
yet had I placed on his little shoulders hands of such tenderness as
those with which, while I rested against the bed, I held him there well</font>
<font color=maroon>under fire.</font> I had no alternative but, in form at
least, to put it to him.</div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“You must tell me now—and
all the truth. What did you go out for? What were you doing there?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>
<font color=magenta>I can still see his wonderful smile, the whites of his beautiful eyes,</font> and
the uncovering of his little teeth shine to me in the dusk. <font color=Goldenrod>“If I tell you why, will you
understand?”</font> My heart, at this, leaped into my mouth. <em>Would</em> he tell me why? <font color=sienna>I
found no sound on my lips to press it,and I was aware of replying only
with a vague, repeated, grimacing nod.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>He was gentleness itself, and while I wagged my head at him he stood there
more than ever a little fairy prince. <font color=magenta>It was his
brightness indeed that gave me a respite.</font> Would it be so great if
he were really going to tell me? <font color=Goldenrod>“Well,”</font> he said at last, <font color=Goldenrod>“just exactly in order that you should
do this.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=7><sup>¶7</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Do</font> what?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=8><sup>¶8</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Think me—for a
change—<em> bad!</em>”</font> I shall never
forget the sweetness and gaiety with which he brought out the word, nor how,
on top of it, <font color=teal>he bent forward and kissed me.</font>
It was practically the end of everything. I met his kiss and I had to make,
while I <font color=teal>folded him <font color=Olive>for a minute</font> in my
arms,</font> the most stupendous effort not to cry. He had given exactly
the account of himself that permitted least of my going behind it, and itwas
only with the effect of confirming my acceptance of it that, <font color=magenta>as I presently glanced about the room,</font> I
could say—</div><div class=paragraph n=9><sup>¶9</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Then you didn’t undress
at all?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=10><sup>¶10</sup>He fairly <font color=magenta>glittered in the gloom.</font>
<font color=Goldenrod><font color=lime>“Not at all. I sat up and read.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=11><sup>¶11</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“And when did you go
down?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=12><sup>¶12</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“<font color=Olive>At midnight</font>.
When I’m bad I <em>am</em> bad!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=13><sup>¶13</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“I
see, I see</font>—it’s charming. But how could you be sure I would
know it?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=14><sup>¶14</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Oh, I arranged that with
Flora.”</font> His answers rang out
with a readiness! <font color=Goldenrod><font color=magenta>“She was to get up and look out.”</font></font></div><font color=Goldenrod>“Which is what she did
do.”</font> It was I who fell into the trap!<div class=paragraph n=16><sup>¶16</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“So she disturbed you,
and, <font color=magenta>to see what she was looking at, you also
looked—you saw.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=17><sup>¶17</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“While you,”</font> I
concurred, <font color=Indigo>“caught your
death in the night air!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=18><sup>¶18</sup>He literally bloomed so from this exploit that he could afford <font color=magenta>radiantly</font> to assent. <font color=Goldenrod>“How otherwise should I have beenbad
enough?”</font> he asked. <font color=teal>Then, after another
embrace,</font> the incident and our interview closed on my recognition
of all the reserves of goodness that, for his joke, he had been able to draw
upon.</div></div><div class=chapter n=12><h3>Chapter: 12</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>The particular impression I had received proved in the <font color=magenta><font color=Olive>morning</font> light,</font>
<font color=mistyrose>I repeat,</font> not quite successfully presentable to
Mrs. Grose, though I reinforced it
with the mention of still another remark that he had made before we
separated. <font color=Indigo>“It all lies
in half a dozen words,”</font> I said to her, <font color=Indigo>“words that really settle the matter.
‘Think, you know, what I <em>might</em>
do!’ He threw that off to show me how good he is. He knows
down to the ground what he ‘might’ do. That’s what he
gave them a taste of at school.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Lord, you do
change!”</font> cried my friend.</div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“I don’t change—I
simply make it out. The four, depend upon it, perpetually meet. If on
either of these <font color=GreenYellow>last nights</font> you had been with either child,
you would clearly have understood. <font color=magenta>The more
I’ve watched</font>
<font color=lightpink>and waited</font> the more I’ve felt that if there were
nothing else to make it sure it would be made so by the systematic
silence of each. <em>Never</em>, by a slip of the
tongue, have they so much as alluded to either of their old friends, any
more than Miles has alluded to his
expulsion. <font color=magenta>Oh, yes, we may sit here and look
at them, and they may show off to us there to their fill;</font> but
even while they pretend to be lost in their fairytale they’re steeped in
their vision of the dead restored. He’s not <font color=lime>reading
to her</font>,”</font> I declared; <font color=Indigo>“they’re talking of <em>them</em>—they’re talking horrors! I go on, I know, as if I were
crazy; and it’s a wonder I’m not. <font color=magenta>What I’ve
seen would have made <em>you</em> so; but it has
only made me more lucid,</font>
<font color=teal>made me get hold of still other
things.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>
<font color=magenta>My lucidity</font> must have seemed awful, but
the charming creatures who were victims of it, passing and repassing in
their interlocked sweetness, <font color=teal>gave my colleague
something to hold on by; and I felt how tight she held as, without
stirring in the breath of my passion,</font>
<font color=magenta>she covered them still with her eyes.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=teal>“Of what other things have you got
hold?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=magenta>“Why, of the very things that have
delighted, fascinated, and yet, at bottom, as I now so strangely
see, mystified and troubled me.</font> Their more than earthly
beauty, their absolutely unnatural goodness. It’s a game,”</font> I
went on; <font color=Indigo>“it’s a policy
and a fraud!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“On the part of little
darlings—?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=7><sup>¶7</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“As yet mere lovely
babies? Yes, mad as that seems!” The very act of bringing it out really
helped me to trace it—follow it all up and piece it all together. “They
haven’t been good—they’ve only been absent. It has been easy to live
with them, because they’re simply leading a life of their own. They’re
not mine—they’re not ours. They’re his and they’re hers!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=8><sup>¶8</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Quint’s and that woman’s?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=9><sup>¶9</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Quint’s and
that woman’s.</font> They want to get to them.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=10><sup>¶10</sup>
<font color=magenta>Oh, how, at this, poor Mrs. Grose appeared to study them!</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“But for
what?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=11><sup>¶11</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“For the love of all
the evil that, in those dreadful <font color=GreenYellow>days</font>, the pair put into
them. And to ply them with that evil still, to keep up the work of
demons, is what brings the others back.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=12><sup>¶12</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Laws!”</font> said my
friend under her breath. The exclamation was homely, but it revealed a real
acceptance of my further proof of what, in the bad time—for there had been a
worse even than this!—must have occurred.</div><div class=paragraph n=13><sup>¶13</sup>There could have been no such justification for me as the plain assent of her
experience to whatever depth of depravity I found credible in our brace of
scoundrels. It was in obvious submission of memory that she brought out
after a moment: <font color=Periwinkle>“They
<em>were</em> rascals! But what can they now do?”</font> she pursued.</div><div class=paragraph n=14><sup>¶14</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Do?”</font></font>
<font color=mistyrose>I echoed</font> so loud that Miles and Flora, as they
passed at their distance, paused an instant in their walk <font color=magenta>and looked at us.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“Don’t they do
enough?”</font> I demanded in a lower tone, while the children, having
smiled and nodded and kissed hands to us, resumed their exhibition. <font color=teal>We were held by it a minute;</font> then I
answered: <font color=Indigo>“They can
destroy them!”</font> At this my companion did turn, <font color=sienna>but the inquiry she launched was a silent one,</font> the effect of which was to make me more explicit. <font color=Indigo>“They don’t know, as yet,
quite how—but they’re trying hard. <font color=magenta>They’re
seen only across, as it were, and beyond—in strange places and on
high places, the top of towers, the roof of houses, the outside of
windows, the further edge of pools;</font> but there’s a deep
design, on either side, to shorten the distance and overcome the
obstacle; and the success of the tempters is only a question of time.
They’ve only to keep to their suggestions of danger.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=15><sup>¶15</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“For the children to
come?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=16><sup>¶16</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“And perish in the
attempt!”</font>Mrs. Grose slowly got up, and I
scrupulously added: <font color=Indigo>“Unless, of course, we can prevent!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=17><sup>¶17</sup>Standing there before me while I kept my seat, <font color=magenta><font color=magenta>she visibly turned things
over.</font></font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Their uncle must do
the preventing. He must take them away.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=18><sup>¶18</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“And who’s to make
him?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=19><sup>¶19</sup>
<font color=magenta>She had been scanning the distance, but she now
dropped on me a foolish face.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“You, miss.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=20><sup>¶20</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=bisque>“By writing to him</font> that his house is poisoned
and his little nephew and niece mad?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=21><sup>¶21</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“But if they <em>are</em>, miss?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=22><sup>¶22</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“And if I am myself,
you mean? That’s charming news to be sent him by a governess whose prime undertaking was to give him
no worry.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=23><sup>¶23</sup>Mrs. Grose considered, following the
children again. <font color=Periwinkle>“Yes,
he do hate worry. <font color=mediumpurple>That was the great
reason—”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=24><sup>¶24</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Why those fiends took
him in so long? No doubt, though his indifference must have been awful.
As I’m not a fiend, at any rate, I shouldn’t take him in.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=25><sup>¶25</sup>My companion, after an instant and for all answer, sat down again and <font color=teal>grasped my arm.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Make him at any rate
come to you.”</font></div><font color=magenta>I stared.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“To <em>me?</em>”</font> I had a sudden fear of what she
might do. <font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“‘Him’?”</font></font><div class=paragraph n=27><sup>¶27</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“He ought to <em>be</em> here—he ought to help.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=28><sup>¶28</sup>I quickly rose, and I think I must have shown her a queerer face than ever
yet. <font color=Indigo>“You see me asking
him for a visit?”</font> No, <font color=magenta>with her eyes
on my face</font> she evidently couldn’t. Instead of it even—<font color=lime>as a woman reads another</font>—she could <font color=magenta>see what I myself saw</font>: his derision, his
amusement, his contempt for the breakdown of my resignation at being left
alone and for the fine machinery I had set in motion to attract his
attention to my slighted charms. <font color=mistyrose>She didn’t know—no
one knew</font>—how proud I had been to serve him and to stick to our
terms; yet she nonetheless took the measure, I think, of the warning I now
gave her. <font color=Indigo>“If you
should so lose your head as to appeal to him for me—”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=29><sup>¶29</sup>She was really frightened. <font color=Periwinkle>“Yes, miss?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=30><sup>¶30</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“I would leave, on the
spot, both him and you.”</font></div></div><div class=chapter n=13><h3>Chapter: 13</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>It was all very well to join them, but speaking to them proved quite as much
as ever an effort beyond my strength—offered, in close quarters,
difficulties as insurmountable as before. This situation continued <font color=GreenYellow>a
month</font>, and with new aggravations and particular notes, the note
above all, sharper and sharper, of the small ironic consciousness on the
part of my pupils. It was not, I am as sure <font color=GreenYellow>today</font> as I was sure
then, my mere infernal imagination: it was absolutely traceable that they
were aware of my predicament and that this strange relation made, in a
manner, for a long time, the air in which we moved. I don’t mean that they
had their tongues in their cheeks or did anything vulgar, for that was not
one of their dangers: I do mean, on the other hand, that the element of the
unnamed and untouched became, between us, greater than any other, and that
so much avoidance could not have been so successfully effected without a
great deal of tacit arrangement. <font color=magenta>It was as if,
at moments, we were perpetually coming into sight of subjects before
which we must stop short, turning suddenly out of alleys that we
perceived to be blind,</font>
<font color=sienna><font color=sienna>closing with a little
bang that made us look at each other—for, like all bangs, it was
something louder than we had intended—the doors we had indiscreetly
opened.</font></font> All roads lead to Rome, and there were times
when it might have struck us that almost every branch of study or subject of
conversation skirted forbidden ground. Forbidden ground was the question of
the return of the dead in general and of whatever, in especial, might
survive, in memory, of the friends little children had lost. There were days
when I could have sworn that one of them had, with a small invisible nudge,
said to the other: “She thinks she’ll do it this time—but she <em>won’t!</em>” To “do it” would have been to
indulge for instance—and for once in a way—in some direct reference to the
lady who had prepared them for my discipline. They had a delightful endless
appetite for passages in my own history, to which I had again and again
treated them; they were in possession of everything that had ever happened
to me, had had, with every circumstance the story of my smallest adventures
and of those of my brothers and sisters and of the cat and the dog at home,
as well as many particulars of the eccentric nature of my father, of the
furniture and arrangement of our house, and of the conversation of the old
women of our village. There were things enough, taking one with another, to
chatter about, if one went very fast and knew by instinct when to go round.
They pulled with an art of their own the strings of my invention and my
memory; <font color=magenta>and nothing else perhaps, when I
thought of such occasions afterward, gave me so the suspicion of being
watched from under cover.</font> It was in any case over <em>my</em> life, <em>my</em> past, and
<em>my</em> friends alone that we could take
anything like our ease—a state of affairs that led them sometimes without
the least pertinence to break out into sociable reminders. I was
invited—with no visible connection—to repeat afresh Goody Gosling’s
celebrated <em><em>mot</em></em> or to confirm the details already supplied as to the cleverness
of the vicarage pony.</div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>It was partly at such junctures as these and partly at quite different ones
that, with the turn my matters had now taken, my predicament, as I have
called it, grew most sensible. The fact that the days passed for me without
another encounter ought, it would have appeared, to have done something
toward soothing my nerves. <font color=teal>Since the light brush,
that <font color=GreenYellow>second night</font> on the upper landing, of the presence of
a woman at the foot of the stair,</font>
<font color=magenta>I had seen nothing, whether in or out of the
house, that one had better not have seen.</font> There was many a corner
round which I expected to come upon Quint, and many a situation that, in a merely sinister way,
would have favored the appearance of Miss
Jessel. <font color=GreenYellow>The summer had turned, the summer
had gone</font>; the autumn had dropped upon Bly and had blown out half our lights. The place, with its <font color=gray>gray</font> sky and withered garlands, its bared
spaces and scattered dead leaves, was like a theater after the
performance—all strewn with crumpled playbills. There were exactly states of
the air, conditions of sound and of stillness, unspeakable impressions of
the <em>kind</em> of ministering moment, that brought
back to me, <font color=teal>long enough to catch it,</font> the
feeling of the medium in which, that <font color=GreenYellow>June</font> evening
out of doors, <font color=magenta>I had had my first sight of
Quint, and in which, too, at
those other instants, I had, after seeing him through the window, looked
for him in vain in the circle of shrubbery.</font>
<font color=mediumblue>I recognized the signs, the portents—I
recognized the moment, the spot.</font> But they remained unaccompanied
and empty, and I continued unmolested; if unmolested one could call a young
woman whose sensibility had, in the most extraordinary fashion, not declined
but deepened. I had said in my talk with Mrs.
Grose on that horrid scene of Flora’s by the lake—and had perplexed her by so saying—that
it would from that moment distress me much more to lose my power than to
keep it. I had then expressed what was vividly in my mind: the truth that,
<font color=magenta>whether the children really saw or not—since,
that is, it was not yet definitely proved—I greatly preferred, as a
safeguard, the fullness of my own exposure.</font> I was ready to know
the very worst that was to be known. What I had then had an ugly glimpse of
was that <font color=magenta>my eyes might be sealed</font> just
while theirs were most opened. <font color=mistyrose>Well, my eyes <em>were</em> sealed,</font> it appeared, at present—a
consummation for which it seemed blasphemous not to thank God. There was,
alas, a difficulty about that: I would have thanked him with all my soul had
I not had in a proportionate measure this conviction of the secret of my
pupils. How can I retrace <font color=GreenYellow>today</font> the strange steps of my
obsession? There were times of our being together when I would have been
ready to swear that, literally, in my presence, but with my direct sense of
it closed, they had visitors who were known and were welcome. Then it was
that, had I not been deterred by the very chance that such an injury might
prove greater than the injury to be averted, my exultation would have broken
out. <font color=Indigo>“They’re here, they’re here, you
little wretches,”</font> I would have cried, <font color=Indigo>“and you can’t deny it now!”</font>. <font color=mistyrose>The little wretches</font> denied it with all the added volume of their
sociability and their tenderness, in just the crystal depths of which—like
the flash of a fish in a stream—the mockery of their advantage peeped up.
The shock, in truth, had sunk into me still deeper than I knew on the night
when, <font color=magenta>looking out to see either Quint or Miss
Jessel under the stars,</font> I had beheld the boy over
whose rest I watched and who had immediately brought in with him—had
straightway, there, turned it on me—the lovely upward look with which, from
the battlements above me, the hideous apparition of Quint had played. If it was a question of a
scare, my discovery on this occasion had scared me more than any other, and
it was in the condition of nerves produced by it that I made my actual
inductions. They harassed me so that sometimes, at odd moments, <font color=sienna>I shut myself up audibly to rehearse—it was at once
a fantastic relief and a renewed despair—the manner in which I might
come to the point.</font> I approached it from one side and the other
while, in my room, I flung myself about, but I always broke down in the
monstrous utterance of names. As they died away on my lips, I said to myself
that I should indeed help them to represent something infamous, if, by
pronouncing them, I should violate as rare a little case of instinctive
delicacy as any schoolroom, probably, had ever known. When I said to myself:
<font color=Indigo>“<em>They</em>
have the manners to be silent, and you, trusted as you are, the baseness
to speak!”</font> I felt myself <font color=crimson>crimson</font>
and <font color=teal>I covered my face with my hands.</font>
<font color=sienna>After these secret scenes I chattered more than
ever, going on volubly enough till one of our prodigious, palpable
hushes occurred—I can call them nothing else—the strange, dizzy lift or
swim (I try for terms!) into a stillness, a pause of all life, that had
nothing to do with the more or less noise that at the moment we might be
engaged in making and that I could hear through any deepened
exhilaration or quickened recitation or louder strum of the piano.</font> Then it was that the others, the outsiders, were there. Though they
were not angels, they “passed,” as the French say, causing me, while they
stayed, to tremble with the fear of their addressing to their younger
victims some yet more infernal message or more vivid image than they had
thought good enough for myself.</div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>What it was most impossible to get rid of was the cruel idea that, <font color=magenta>whatever I had seen,</font>
<font color=magenta>Miles and Flora saw <em>more</em>—things terrible and unguessable</font> and that sprang from
dreadful passages of intercourse in the past. Such things naturally left on
the surface, for the time, a chill which we vociferously denied that we
felt; and we had, all three, with <font color=mistyrose>repetition</font>,
got into such splendid training that we went, each time, almost
automatically, to mark the close of the incident, through the very same
movements. It was striking of the children, at all events, to kiss me
inveterately with a kind of wild irrelevance and never to fail—one or the
other—of the precious question that had helped us through many a peril.
<font color=Periwinkle>“When do you think
he _will_ come? Don’t you think <font color=bisque>we <em>ought</em> to write?”</font></font> —there was nothing like that inquiry, we found by experience, for
carrying off an awkwardness. “He” of course was their uncle
in Harley Street; and we lived in much profusion of theory that he might at any
moment arrive to mingle in our circle. It was impossible to have given less
encouragement than he had done to such a doctrine, but if we had not had the
doctrine to fall back upon we should have deprived each other of some of our
finest exhibitions. <font color=purple>He never wrote to
them</font>—that may have been selfish, but it was a part of the flattery of
his trust of me; for the way in which a man pays his highest tribute to a
woman is apt to be but by the more festal celebration of one of the sacred
laws of his comfort; and I held that I carried out the spirit of the pledge
given not to appeal to him <font color=bisque>when I let my charges
understand that their own letters were but charming literary exercises.
They were too beautiful to be posted; I kept them myself; I have them
all to this hour.</font> This was a rule indeed which only added to the
satiric effect of my being plied with the supposition that he might at any
moment be among us. It was exactly as if my charges knew how almost more
awkward than anything else that might be for me. <font color=magenta>There appears to me, moreover, as I look back,</font> no note in all this more extraordinary than the mere fact that, in
spite of my tension and of their triumph, I never lost patience with them.
Adorable they must in truth have been, I now reflect, that I didn’t in these
days hate them! Would exasperation, however, if relief had longer been
postponed, finally have betrayed me? It little matters, for relief arrived.
I call it relief, though it was only the relief that a snap brings to a
strain or the burst of a thunderstorm to a day of suffocation. It was at
least change, and it came with a rush.</div></div><div class=chapter n=14><h3>Chapter: 14</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>Walking to church a certain <font color=GreenYellow>Sunday</font>
<font color=Olive>morning</font>, I had little Miles at
my side and his sister, in advance of us and at Mrs. Grose’s, well in sight. <font color=lightpink>It was a
crisp, clear day, the first of its order for some time; <font color=Olive>the
night</font> had brought a touch of frost, and the autumn air,
bright and sharp,</font> made the church bells almost gay. It was an odd
accident of thought that I should have happened at such a moment to be
particularly and very gratefully struck with the obedience of my little
charges. Why did they never resent my inexorable, my perpetual society?
Something or other had brought nearer home to me <font color=teal>that I had all but pinned the boy to my shawl and that,</font> in the
way our companions were marshaled before me, I might have appeared to
provide against some danger of rebellion. <font color=magenta><font color=magenta>I was like a gaoler with an eye to possible
surprises and escapes.</font></font> But all this belonged—I mean
their magnificent little surrender—just to the special array of the facts
that were most abysmal. Turned out for <font color=GreenYellow>Sunday</font> by his uncle’s
tailor, who had had a free hand and a notion of pretty waistcoats and of his
grand little air, Miles’s whole title to
independence, the rights of his sex and situation, were so stamped upon him
that if he had suddenly struck for freedom I should have had nothing to say.
I was by the strangest of chances wondering how I should meet him when the
revolution unmistakably occurred. I call it a revolution because <font color=magenta>I now see how,</font> with the word he spoke,
the curtain rose on the last act of my dreadful drama, and the catastrophe
was precipitated. <font color=Goldenrod>“Look
here, my dear, you know,”</font> he charmingly said, <font color=Goldenrod>“when in the world, please, am I going
back to school?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>
<font color=whitesmoke>Transcribed here the speech sounds harmless enough,</font>
<font color=sienna>particularly as uttered in the sweet, high, casual
pipe with which, at all interlocutors, but above all at his eternal governess, he threw off
intonations as if he were tossing roses.</font>
<font color=teal>There was something in them that always made one
“catch,” and I caught,</font> at any rate, now so effectually that I
stopped as short as if one of the trees of the park had fallen across the
road. There was something new, on the spot, between us, and he was perfectly
aware that I recognized it, though, toenable me to do so, he had no need to
look a whit less candid and charming than usual. I could feel in him how he
already, from my at first finding nothing to reply, perceived the advantage
he had gained. I was so slow to find anything that he had plenty of time,
after <font color=Olive>a minute</font>, to continue with his suggestive but
inconclusive smile: <font color=Goldenrod>“You
know, my dear, that for a fellow to be with a lady <em>always</em>—!”</font> His “my dear” was
constantly on his lips for me, and nothing could have expressed more the
exact shade of the sentiment with which I desired to inspire my pupils than
its fond familiarity. It was so respectfully easy.</div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>But, oh, how I felt that at present I must pick my own phrases! I remember
that, to gain time, I tried to laugh, and <font color=magenta>I
seemed to see in the beautiful face with which he watched me how ugly
and queer I looked.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“And always with the same
lady?”</font> I returned.</div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>
<font color=magenta>He neither blanched nor winked.</font> The whole
thing was virtually out between us. <font color=Goldenrod>“Ah, of course, she’s a jolly, ‘perfect’ lady; but,
after all, I’m a fellow, don’t you see? that’s—well, getting on.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>I lingered there with him an instant ever so kindly. <font color=Indigo>“Yes, you’re getting on.”</font> Oh, but I
felt helpless!</div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>I have kept to <font color=GreenYellow>this day</font> the heartbreaking little idea of how he
seemed to know that and to play with it. <font color=Goldenrod>“And you can’t say I’ve not been awfully good, can
you?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=7><sup>¶7</sup>
<font color=teal>I laid my hand on his shoulder,</font> for, though
I felt how much better it would have been to walk on, I was not yet quite
able. <font color=Indigo>“No, I can’t say
that, Miles.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=8><sup>¶8</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod><font color=mediumpurple>“Except just that <font color=GreenYellow>one night</font>, you
know—!”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=9><sup>¶9</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“That <font color=GreenYellow>one night</font>?”</font></font> I couldn’t look as straight as he.</div><div class=paragraph n=10><sup>¶10</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Why, when I went
down—went out of the house.” </font>,</div><div class=paragraph n=11><sup>¶11</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Oh, yes. But I forget
what you did it for.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=12><sup>¶12</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“You forget?”</font>— <font color=sienna>he spoke with the sweet extravagance of childish
reproach.</font>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Why, it was to show you I
could!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=13><sup>¶13</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Oh, yes, you could.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=14><sup>¶14</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“And I can
again.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=15><sup>¶15</sup>I felt that I might, perhaps, after all, succeed in keeping my wits about me.
<font color=Indigo>“Certainly. But you
won’t.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=16><sup>¶16</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“No, not <em>that</em> again. It was nothing.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=17><sup>¶17</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“It was nothing,”</font></font> I said. <font color=Indigo>“But we
must go on.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=18><sup>¶18</sup>He resumed our walk with me, <font color=teal>passing his hand into
my arm.</font>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Then when <em>am</em> I going back?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=19><sup>¶19</sup>I wore, in turning it over, my most responsible air. <font color=Indigo>“Were you very happy at school?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=20><sup>¶20</sup>He just considered. <font color=Goldenrod><font color=mistyrose>“Oh, I’m happy</font> enough anywhere!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=21><sup>¶21</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Well, then,”</font> I
quavered, <font color=Indigo><font color=mediumpurple>“if you’re just as happy here—!”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=22><sup>¶22</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Ah, but that isn’t
everything! Of course <em>you</em> know a lot—”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=23><sup>¶23</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“But you hint that you
know almost as much?”</font> I risked as he paused.</div><div class=paragraph n=24><sup>¶24</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Not half I want
to!”</font>Miles honestly professed. <font color=Goldenrod>“But it isn’t so much that.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=25><sup>¶25</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“What is it,
then?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=26><sup>¶26</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Well—I want to see more
life.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=27><sup>¶27</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“I see; I see.”</font></font> We had <font color=magenta>arrived within sight of the
church</font> and of various persons, including several of the household
of Bly, on their way to it and clustered about the door to see us go
in. I quickened our step; I wanted to get there before the question between
us opened up much further; I reflected hungrily that, <font color=Olive>for more than an
hour</font>, he would have to be silent; and I thought with envy of the
comparative <font color=Olive>dusk</font> of the pew and of the almost spiritual help of
the hassock on which I might bend my knees. I seemed literally to be running
a race with some confusion to which he was about to reduce me, but I felt
that he had got in first when, before we had even entered the churchyard, he
threw out— <font color=Goldenrod>“I want my own
sort!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=28><sup>¶28</sup>It literally made me bound forward. <font color=Indigo>“There are not many of <font color=mistyrose>your own
sort, </font>Miles!”</font> I laughed. <font color=Indigo>“Unless perhaps dear little
Flora!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=29><sup>¶29</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“You really compare me to
a baby girl?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=30><sup>¶30</sup>This found me singularly weak. <font color=Indigo>“Don’t you, then, <em>love</em> our
sweet Flora?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=31><sup>¶31</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod><font color=mediumpurple>“If I didn’t—and you, too; if I didn’t—!”</font></font>
<font color=mistyrose>he repeated</font> as if retreating for a jump, yet
leaving his thought so unfinished that, after we had come into the gate,
another stop, <font color=teal>which he imposed on me by the
pressure of his arm,</font> had become inevitable. Mrs. Grose and Flora had passed into the church, the other worshippers had
followed, and we were, for <font color=Olive>the minute</font>, alone among the old,
thick graves. We had paused, on the path from the gate, by a low, oblong,
tablelike tomb.</div><div class=paragraph n=32><sup>¶32</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Yes, if you didn’t—?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=33><sup>¶33</sup>
<font color=magenta>He looked,</font>
<font color=lightpink>while I waited,</font> at the graves. <font color=Goldenrod>“Well, you know what!”</font> But he
didn’t move, and he presently produced something that made me drop straight
down on the stone slab, as if suddenly to rest. <font color=Goldenrod>“Does my uncle think what <em>you</em> think?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=34><sup>¶34</sup>I markedly rested. <font color=Indigo>“How do
you know what I think?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=35><sup>¶35</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Ah, well, of course I
don’t; for it strikes me you never tell me. But I mean does <em>he</em> know?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=36><sup>¶36</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Know</font> what, Miles?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=37><sup>¶37</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Why, the way I’m going
on.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=38><sup>¶38</sup>I perceived quickly enough that I could make, to this inquiry, no answer that
would not involve something of a sacrifice of my employer.</div><font color=magenta>Yet it appeared to me</font> that we were all,
at Bly, sufficiently sacrificed to make that venial. <font color=Indigo>“I don’t think your uncle
much cares.”</font><div class=paragraph n=40><sup>¶40</sup>
<font color=magenta>>Miles, on this,
stood looking at me.</font>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Then don’t you think he
can be made to?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=41><sup>¶41</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“In what way?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=42><sup>¶42</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Why, by his coming
down.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=43><sup>¶43</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“But who’ll get him <font color=mistyrose>to come down?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=44><sup>¶44</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“<em>I</em> will!”</font> the boy said with extraordinary brightness
and emphasis. <font color=magenta>He gave me another look charged
with that expression</font> and then marched off alone into church.</div></div><div class=chapter n=15><h3>Chapter: 15</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>The business was practically settled from the moment I never followed him. It
was a pitiful surrender to agitation, but my being aware of this had somehow
no power to restore me. I only sat there on my tomb and <font color=lime>read into what my little friend had said to me
the fullness of its meaning;</font> by the time I had grasped the whole
of which I had also embraced, for absence, the pretext that I was ashamed to
offer my pupils and the rest of the congregation such an example of delay.
What I said to myself above all was that Miles had got something out of me and that the proof of it,
for him, would be just this awkward collapse. He had got out of me that
there was something I was much afraid of and that he should probably be able
to make use of my fear to gain, for his own purpose, more freedom. My fear
was of having to deal with the intolerable question of the grounds of his
dismissal from school, for that was really but the question of the horrors
gathered behind. <font color=lightpink>That his uncle should arrive to treat with
me of these things was a solution that, strictly speaking, I ought now
to have desired to bring on; but I could so little face the ugliness and
the pain of it that I simply procrastinated and lived from hand to
mouth.</font> The boy, to my deep discomposure, was immensely in the
right, was in a position to say to me: <font color=Indigo>“Either you clear up with my guardian the mystery of this <font color=mediumpurple>interruption of my studies,</font> or you
cease to expect me to lead with you a life that’s so unnatural for a
boy.”</font> What was so unnatural for the particular boy I was concerned with
was this sudden revelation of a consciousness and a plan.</div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>That was what really overcame me, what prevented my going in. I walked round
the church, <font color=lightpink>hesitating, hovering;</font> I reflected that I
had already, with him, hurt myself beyond repair. Therefore I could patch up
nothing, <font color=teal>and it was too extreme an effort to
squeeze beside him into the pew: he would be so much more sure than ever
to pass his arm into mine and make me sit there for <font color=Olive>an hour</font>
in close, silent contact with his commentary on our talk.</font> For the
<font color=Olive>first minute</font> since his arrival I wanted to get away from
him. <font color=lightpink>As I paused beneath the high east window</font> and
<font color=sienna>listened to the sounds of worship,</font> I was
taken with an impulse that might master me, I felt, completely should I give
it the least encouragement. I might easily put an end to my predicament by
getting away altogether. Here was my chance; there was no one to stop me; I
could give the whole thing up—turn my back and retreat. It was only a
question of hurrying again, for a few preparations, to the house which the
attendance at church of so many of the servants would practically have left
unoccupied. No one, in short, could blame me if I should just drive
desperately off. What was it to get away if I got away only till dinner?
That would be <font color=Olive>in a couple of hours</font>, at the end of which—I had
the acute prevision—my little pupils would play at innocent wonder about my
nonappearance in their train.</div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>“What <em>did</em> you do, you naughty, bad thing? Why in the
world, to worry us so—and take our thoughts off, too, don’t you
know?—did you desert us at the very door?” <font color=magenta>I couldn’t meet such questions nor, as they asked
them, their false little lovely eyes;</font> yet it was all so exactly
what I should have to meet that, as the prospect grew sharp to me, I at last
let myself go.</div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>I got, so far as the immediate moment was concerned, away; I came straight
out of the churchyard and, thinking hard, retraced my steps through the
park. It seemed to me that by the time I reached the house I had made up my
mind I would fly. The <font color=GreenYellow>Sunday</font> stillness both of the approaches
and of the interior, in which I met no one, fairly excited me with a sense
of opportunity. Were I to get off quickly, this way, I should get off
without a scene, without a word. My quickness would have to be remarkable,
however, and the question of a conveyance was the great one to settle.
Tormented, in the hall, with difficulties and obstacles, I remember sinking
down at the foot of the staircase—suddenly collapsing there on the lowest
step and then, with a revulsion, recalling that it was exactly where more
than <font color=GreenYellow>a month</font> before, <font color=magenta>in the darkness
of night and just so bowed with evil things, I had seen the specter of
the most horrible of women.</font> At this I was able to straighten
myself; I went the rest of the way up; I made, in my bewilderment, for the
schoolroom, where there were objects belonging to me that I should have to
take. <font color=magenta>But I opened the door to find again, in a
flash, my eyes unsealed.</font>
<font color=magenta>In the presence of what I saw I reeled straight
back upon my resistance.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>Seated at my own table in clear noonday light I saw a person whom, without my
previous experience, I should have taken at the first blush for some
housemaid who might have stayed at home to look after the place and who,
availing herself of rare relief from observation and of the schoolroom <font color=lemonchiffon>table and my pens, ink, and paper, had applied
herself to the considerable effort of a letter to her sweetheart.</font>
There was an effort in the way that, while her arms rested on the table, her
hands with evident weariness supported her head; but at the moment I took
this in I had already become aware that, in spite of my entrance, her
attitude strangely persisted. Then it was—with the very act of its
announcing itself—that her identity flared up in a change of posture. She
rose, not as if she had heard me, but with an indescribable grand melancholy
of indifference and detachment, and, within a dozen feet of me, stood there
as my vile predecessor. Dishonored and tragic, she was all before me; <font color=magenta><font color=teal>but even as I fixed
and, for memory, secured it, the awful image passed
away.</font></font> Dark as <font color=Olive>midnight</font> in her <font color=plum>black</font> dress, her haggard beauty and her
unutterable woe, <font color=magenta>she had looked at me</font> long
enough to appear to say that her right to sit at my table was as good as
mine to sit at hers. While these instants lasted, indeed, I had the
extraordinary chill of feeling that it was I who was the intruder. It was as
a wild protest against it that, actually addressing her—<font color=Indigo>“You terrible,
miserable woman!”</font>— <font color=sienna>I heard myself break
into a sound that, by the open door, rang through the long passage and
the empty house.</font>
<font color=magenta>She looked at me</font>
<font color=sienna>as if she heard me,</font> but I had recovered
myself and cleared the air. There was nothing in the room the next minute
but the sunshine and a sense that I must stay.</div></div><div class=chapter n=16><h3>Chapter: 16</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>I had so perfectly expected that the return of my pupils would be marked by a
demonstration that I was freshly upset at having to take into account that
they were dumb about my absence. Instead of gaily denouncing and caressing
me, they made no allusion to my having failed them, and I was left, for the
time, on perceiving that she too said nothing, to study Mrs. Grose’s odd face. I did this to such
purpose that I made sure they had in some way bribed her to silence; a
silence that, however, I would engage to break down on the first private
opportunity. This opportunity came before tea: I secured <font color=Olive>five
minutes</font> with her in the housekeeper’s room, where, in the
twilight, <font color=Peru>amid a smell of lately baked
bread,</font> but with the place all swept and garnished, I found her
sitting in pained placidity <font color=maroon>before the fire.</font>
<font color=magenta><font color=mistyrose>So I see her still, so I
see her best</font>: <font color=maroon>facing the flame</font> from her
straight chair in the dusky, shining room, a large clean image of the
“put away”—of drawers closed and locked and rest without a remedy.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Oh, yes, they asked me
to say nothing; and to please them—so long as they were there—of course
I promised. But what had happened to you?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“I only went with you
for the walk,”</font> I said. <font color=Indigo>“I had then to come back to meet a friend.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>
<font color=magenta>She showed her surprise.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“A friend—<em>you?</em>”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Oh, yes, I have a
couple!”</font> I laughed. <font color=Indigo>“But did the children give you a reason?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“For not alluding to your
leaving us? <font color=mistyrose>Yes; they said you would like it better.
Do you like it better?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=7><sup>¶7</sup>My face had made her rueful. <font color=Indigo>“No, I like it worse!”</font> But after an instant I
added: <font color=Indigo>“Did they say
why I should <font color=mistyrose>like it better?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=8><sup>¶8</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“No; Master Miles only said, ‘We must do nothing
but what she likes!’”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=9><sup>¶9</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“I wish indeed he
would. And what did Flora say?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=10><sup>¶10</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Miss Flora was too sweet. She said, ‘Oh,
<font color=mistyrose>of course, of course!’</font> —and I said the same.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=11><sup>¶11</sup>I thought a moment. <font color=Indigo>“You
were too sweet, too—<font color=sienna>I can hear you all.</font> But nonetheless, between Miles
and me, it’s now all out.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=12><sup>¶12</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=mistyrose>“All out?”</font></font>
<font color=magenta>My companion stared.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“But what,
miss?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=13><sup>¶13</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Everything. It doesn’t
matter. I’ve made up my mind. I came home, my dear,”</font> I went on,
<font color=Indigo>“for a talk with
Miss Jessel.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=14><sup>¶14</sup>I had by this time formed the habit of having Mrs.
Grose literally <font color=teal>well in hand</font> in advance of my sounding that note; so that even now, as she bravely
blinked under the signal of my word, I could keep her comparatively firm.
<font color=Periwinkle>“A talk! Do you
mean she spoke?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=15><sup>¶15</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“It came to that. I
found her, on my return, in the schoolroom.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=16><sup>¶16</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“And what did she
say?”</font>
<font color=sienna>I can hear the good woman still,</font> and the
candor of her stupefaction.</div><div class=paragraph n=17><sup>¶17</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“That she suffers the
torments—!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=18><sup>¶18</sup>It was this, of a truth, that made her, <font color=magenta>as she
filled out my picture, gape.</font>
<font color=mediumpurple><font color=Periwinkle>“Do you mean,”</font> she faltered, <font color=Periwinkle>“—of the lost?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=19><sup>¶19</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Of the lost. Of the
damned. And that’s why, <font color=mediumpurple>to share them—”</font></font> I faltered myself with the horror of it.</div><div class=paragraph n=20><sup>¶20</sup>But my companion, with less imagination, kept me up. <font color=Periwinkle><font color=mistyrose>“To share them—?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=21><sup>¶21</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“She wants Flora.”</font>Mrs. Grose might, as I gave it to her,
fairly have fallen away from me had I not been prepared. <font color=teal>I still held her there, to show I was.</font>

<font color=Indigo>“Ah, but I will, I

has ideas of what he gains by that—he shall see he’s mistaken. Yes, yes;

himself, if necessary) that if I’m to be reproached with <font color=mediumpurple>having done nothing again about more
school—”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=28><sup>¶28</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=mediumpurple>“Yes, miss—”</font></font> my companion <font color=teal>pressed me.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=29><sup>¶29</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Well, there’s that

excusable for being vague. <font color=Periwinkle>“But—a—which?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=31><sup>¶31</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Why, <font color=bisque>the letter</font> from his old place.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=32><sup>¶32</sup>

<font color=Periwinkle>“Oh, no!”</font> said
Mrs. Grose with decision.</div><div class=paragraph n=35><sup>¶35</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“I’ll put it before
him,”</font> I went on inexorably, <font color=Indigo>“that I can’t undertake to work the question on behalf
of a child who has been expelled—”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=36><sup>¶36</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“For we’ve never in the

<font color=Indigo>“For wickedness. For
what else—when he’s so clever and beautiful and perfect? Is he stupid?
Is he untidy? Is he infirm? Is he ill-natured? He’s exquisite—so it can
be only <em>that</em>; and that would open up the
whole thing. After all,”</font> I said, <font color=Indigo>“it’s their uncle’s fault. <font color=mediumpurple>If he left here such people—!”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=38><sup>¶38</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“He didn’t really in

<font color=magenta>She had turned quite pale.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=39><sup>¶39</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Well, you shan’t

<font color=Periwinkle>“The children

<font color=sienna>I was silent awhile;</font>

<font color=Periwinkle>“You needn’t tell him

myself up.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“How do you

<font color=Periwinkle>“I tell the bailiff.

<font color=Periwinkle><font color=purple>“Ah, miss, <em>you</em>
write!”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=47><sup>¶47</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Well—tonight,”</font> I at last answered; <font color=teal>and on this we separated.</font></div></div><div class=chapter n=17><h3>Chapter: 17</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>I went so far, in the evening, as to make a beginning. The weather had
changed back, a great wind was abroad, and beneath the lamp, in my room,
with Flora at peace beside me, <font color=whitesmoke>I sat for a long time before a blank sheet of paper</font>
and <font color=sienna>listened to the lash of the rain and the
batter of the gusts.</font>
<font color=maroon>Finally I went out, taking a candle;</font> I crossed the
passage <font color=sienna>and listened <font color=Olive>a minute</font> at
Miles’s door.</font> What, under my
endless obsession, <font color=sienna>I had been impelled to listen
for was some betrayal of his not being at rest,</font> and <font color=teal>I presently caught one,</font> but not in the form
I had expected. <font color=sienna>His voice tinkled out.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“I say, you there—come in.”</font> It was
a gaiety in the gloom! <font color=maroon>I went in with my light</font> and
found him, in bed, very wide awake, but very much at his ease. <font color=Goldenrod>“Well, what are <em>you</em> up to?”</font> he asked with a grace of
sociability in which it occurred to me that Mrs.
Grose, had she been present, might have looked in vain for
proof that anything was “out.”</div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>
<font color=maroon>I stood over him with my candle.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“How did you know I was
there?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Why, of course I heard
you. Did you fancy you made no noise? You’re like a troop of cavalry!”</font> he beautifully laughed.</div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Then you weren’t
asleep?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Not much! I lie awake and
think.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>
<font color=maroon>I had put my candle,</font> designedly, a short way off, and
then, <font color=teal>as he held out his friendly old hand to me,</font> had sat down on the edge of his bed.</div><div class=paragraph n=7><sup>¶7</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“What is it,”</font> I
asked, <font color=Indigo>“that you think
of?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=8><sup>¶8</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“What in the world, my
dear, but <em>you?</em>”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=9><sup>¶9</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Ah, the pride I take in
your appreciation doesn’t insist on that! I had so far rather you
slept.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=10><sup>¶10</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Well, I think also, you
know, of this queer business of ours.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=11><sup>¶11</sup>
<font color=teal>I marked the coolness of his firm little
hand.</font>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Of what queer business, Miles?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=12><sup>¶12</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Why, the way you bring me
up. And all the rest!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=13><sup>¶13</sup>I fairly held my breath <font color=Olive>a minute</font>, <font color=maroon>and even from
my glimmering taper there was <font color=magenta>light enough to
show how he smiled up at me from his pillow.</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=14><sup>¶14</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“What do you mean by <font color=mistyrose>all the rest?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=15><sup>¶15</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Oh, <font color=mistyrose>you know, you know!”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=16><sup>¶16</sup>I could say nothing for <font color=Olive>a minute</font>, though I felt, <font color=teal>as I held his hand</font>
<font color=magenta>and our eyes continued to meet,</font> that my
<font color=sienna>silence had all the air</font> of admitting
his charge and that nothing in the whole world of reality was perhaps at
that moment so fabulous as our actual relation. <font color=Indigo>“Certainly you shall go back to school,”</font> I said, <font color=Indigo>“if it be
that that troubles you. But not to the old place—we must find another, a
better. How could I know it did trouble you, this question, when you
never told me so, never spoke of it at all?”</font>
<font color=magenta>His clear, listening face, framed in its smooth
whiteness, made him for the minute as
appealing as some wistful patient in a children’s hospital;</font> and I
would have given, as the resemblance came to me, all I possessed on earth
really to be the nurse or the sister of charity who might have helped to
cure him. Well, even as it was, I perhaps might help! <font color=Indigo>“Do you know you’ve never said a word to me
about your school—I mean the old one; never mentioned it in any way?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=17><sup>¶17</sup>He seemed to wonder; he smiled with the same loveliness. But he clearly
gained time; he waited, he called for guidance. <font color=Goldenrod>“Haven’t I?”</font> It wasn’t for
<em>me</em> to help him—it was for the thing I had
met!</div><div class=paragraph n=18><sup>¶18</sup>Something in his tone and the expression of his face, as I got this from him,
set my heart aching with such a pang as it had never yet known; so
unutterably touching was it to see his little brain puzzled and his little
resources taxed to play, under the spell laid on him, a part of innocence
and consistency. <font color=Indigo>“No,
never—from <font color=Olive>the hour</font> you came back. You’ve never mentioned
to me one of your masters, one of your comrades, nor the least little
thing that ever happened to you at school. <font color=mistyrose>Never,
little Miles—no, never</font>—have
you given me an inkling of anything that <em>may</em>
have happened there. Therefore you can fancy how much I’m in the dark.
Until you came out, that way, <font color=Olive>this morning</font>, you had, since
the <font color=Olive>first hour</font> I saw you, scarce even made a reference to
anything in your previous life. You seemed so perfectly to accept the
present.”</font> It was extraordinary how my absolute conviction of his
secret precocity (or whatever I might call the poison of an influence that I
dared but half to phrase) made him, in spite of the faint breath of his
inward trouble, appear as accessible as an older person—imposed him almost
as an intellectual equal. <font color=Indigo>“I thought you wanted to go on as you are.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=19><sup>¶19</sup>
<font color=magenta>It struck me that at this he just faintly
colored.</font> He gave, at any rate, like a convalescent slightly
fatigued, a languid shake of his head. <font color=Goldenrod><font color=mistyrose>“I don’t—I don’t.</font> I want to get away.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=20><sup>¶20</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“You’re tired of
Bly?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=21><sup>¶21</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Oh, no, I like Bly.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=22><sup>¶22</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Well, then—?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=23><sup>¶23</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Oh, <em>you</em> know what a boy wants!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=24><sup>¶24</sup>I felt that I didn’t know so well as Miles,
and I took temporary refuge. <font color=Indigo>“You want to go to your uncle?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=25><sup>¶25</sup>Again, at this, with his sweet ironic face, he made a movement on the pillow.
<font color=Goldenrod>“Ah, you can’t get off
with that!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=26><sup>¶26</sup>
<font color=sienna>I was silent a little,</font> and it was I, now, I
think, who changed color.</div><div class=paragraph n=27><sup>¶27</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“My dear, I don’t want to get off!”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=28><sup>¶28</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod><font color=mistyrose>“You can’t, even if you do. You can’t, you can’t!”</font></font> — <font color=magenta>he lay beautifully staring.</font>
<font color=Goldenrod>“My uncle must come down,
and you must completely settle things.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=29><sup>¶29</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“If we do,”</font> I
returned with some spirit, <font color=Indigo>“you may be sure it will be to take you quite away.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=30><sup>¶30</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Well, don’t you
understand that that’s exactly what I’m working for? You’ll have to tell
him—about the way you’ve let it all drop: <font color=mistyrose>you’ll
have to tell him</font> a tremendous lot!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=31><sup>¶31</sup>The exultation with which he uttered this helped me somehow, for the instant,
to meet him rather more. <font color=Indigo>“And how much will <em>you</em>, Miles, <font color=mistyrose>have to tell
him?</font> There are things he’ll ask you!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=32><sup>¶32</sup>He turned it over. <font color=Goldenrod>“Very
likely. <font color=mistyrose>But what things?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=33><sup>¶33</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“The things</font> you’ve never told me. To make up
his mind what to do with you. He can’t send you back—”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=34><sup>¶34</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Oh, I don’t want to go
<font color=mistyrose>back!”</font></font> he broke in. <font color=Goldenrod>“I
want a new field.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=35><sup>¶35</sup>He said it with admirable serenity, with positive unimpeachable gaiety; and
doubtless it was that very note that most evoked for me the poignancy, the
unnatural childish tragedy, of his probable reappearance <font color=GreenYellow>at the end of
three</font> months with all this bravado and still more dishonor. It
overwhelmed me now that I should never be able to bear that, and it made me
let myself go. <font color=teal>I threw myself upon him and in the
tenderness of my pity I embraced him.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“Dear little Miles, dear little Miles—!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=36><sup>¶36</sup>My face was close to his, and <font color=teal>he let me kiss
him</font>, simply taking it with indulgent good humor. <font color=Goldenrod>“Well, old lady?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=37><sup>¶37</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Is there <font color=mistyrose>nothing—nothing</font> at all that you want to
tell me?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=38><sup>¶38</sup>He turned off a little, facing round toward the wall and holding up his hand
to look at as one had seen sick children look. <font color=Goldenrod><font color=mistyrose>“I’ve told you—I told you</font>
<font color=Olive>this morning</font>.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=39><sup>¶39</sup>Oh, I was sorry for him! <font color=Indigo>“That you just want me not to worry you?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=40><sup>¶40</sup>
<font color=magenta>He looked round at me now, as if in recognition
of my understanding him;</font> then ever so gently, <font color=Goldenrod>“To let me alone,”</font> he
replied.</div><div class=paragraph n=41><sup>¶41</sup>There was even a singular little dignity in it, <font color=teal>something that made me release him,</font> yet, when I had slowly
risen, linger beside him. God knows I never wished to harass him, but I felt
that merely, at this, to turn my back on him was to abandon or, to put it
more truly, to lose him.</div><div class=paragraph n=42><sup>¶42</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“I’ve just <font color=bisque>begun a letter to your uncle,”</font></font> I said.</div><div class=paragraph n=43><sup>¶43</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Well, then, finish
it!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=44><sup>¶44</sup>I waited <font color=Olive>a minute</font>. <font color=Indigo>“What happened before?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=45><sup>¶45</sup>He gazed up at me again. <font color=Goldenrod><font color=mistyrose>“Before</font> what?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=46><sup>¶46</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Before</font> you came back. And <font color=mistyrose>before</font> you went away.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=47><sup>¶47</sup>
<font color=sienna>For some time he was silent,</font> but he
continued <font color=magenta>to meet my eyes.</font>
<font color=Goldenrod>“What
happened?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=48><sup>¶48</sup>It made me, <font color=sienna>the sound of the words,</font> in which
it seemed to me that <font color=teal>I caught for the very first
time a small faint quaver of consenting consciousness</font>—it made me
drop on my knees beside the bed and seize once more the chance of possessing
him. <font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Dear little Miles, dear little Miles,</font> if you <em>knew</em> how I want to help you! It’s only that, it’s nothing but that,
and I’d rather die than give you a pain or do you a wrong—<font color=mistyrose>I’d rather die</font> than hurt a hair of you. <font color=mistyrose>Dear little Miles”</font></font> —oh, I brought it out now even if I <em>should</em> go too far—<font color=Indigo>“I just want you to help me to save you!”</font> But I
knew in a moment after this that I had gone too far. The answer to my appeal
was instantaneous, but it came in the form of an extraordinary blast and
chill, a gust of frozen air, and a shake of the room as great as if, in the
wild wind, the casement had crashed in. <font color=sienna>The boy
gave a loud, high shriek, which, lost in the rest of the shock of sound,</font> might have seemed, indistinctly, though I was so close to him, a note
either of jubilation or of terror. I jumped to my feet again and was
conscious of darkness. So for a moment we remained, while <font color=magenta>I stared about me and saw that the drawn curtains
were unstirred and the window tight.</font>
<font color=Indigo><font color=maroon>“Why, the candle’s out!”</font></font> I then cried.</div><div class=paragraph n=49><sup>¶49</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“It was I who blew it,
dear!”</font> said Miles.</div></div><div class=chapter n=18><h3>Chapter: 18</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>
<font color=GreenYellow>The next day</font>, after lessons, Mrs.
Grose found a moment to say to me quietly: <font color=Periwinkle><font color=bisque>“Have you written, miss?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=bisque>“Yes—I’ve written.”</font></font> But I didn’t add—for <font color=Olive>the hour</font>—that <font color=bisque>my letter, sealed and directed, was still in my pocket.</font> There
would be time enough to send it before the messenger should go to the
village. Meanwhile there had been, on the part of my pupils, no more
brilliant, more exemplary morning. It was exactly as if they had both had at
heart to gloss over any recent little friction. They performed the dizziest
feats of arithmetic, soaring quite out of <em>my</em>
feeble range, and perpetrated, in higher spirits than ever, geographical and
historical jokes. It was conspicuous of course in Miles in particular that he appeared to wish to show how
easily he could let me down. This child, to my memory, really lives in a
setting of beauty and misery that no words can translate; there was a
distinction all his own in every impulse he revealed; never was a small
natural creature, <font color=magenta>to the uninitiated eye</font>
all frankness and freedom, a more ingenious, a more extraordinary little
gentleman. I had perpetually to guard against the wonder of contemplation
into which <font color=magenta>my initiated view betrayed me; to
check the irrelevant gaze</font> and <font color=sienna>discouraged sigh</font> in which I constantly both attacked and
renounced the enigma of what such a little gentleman could have done that
deserved a penalty. Say that, by the dark prodigy I knew, the imagination of
all evil <em>had</em> been opened up to him: all the
justice within me ached for the proof that it could ever have flowered into
an act.</div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>He had never, at any rate, been such a little gentleman as when, after our
early dinner on <font color=GreenYellow>this dreadful day</font>, he came round to me and
asked if I shouldn’t like him, for <font color=Olive>half an hour</font>, to play to me.
David playing to Saul could never have shown
a finer sense of the occasion. It was literally a charming exhibition of
tact, of magnanimity, and quite tantamount to his saying outright: <font color=Indigo>“The true knights we love to read about never push an advantage
too far. I know what you mean now: you mean that—to be let alone
yourself and not followed up—you’ll cease to worry and spy upon me,
won’t keep me so close to you, will let me go and come. Well, I
‘come,’ you see—but I don’t go! There’ll be plenty of time for that.
I do really delight in your society, and I only want to show you
that I contended for a principle.”</font> It may be imagined whether I resisted this appeal <font color=teal>or failed to accompany him again, hand in hand,</font> to the schoolroom. <font color=sienna>He sat down at the old
piano and played as he had never played;</font> and if there are those
who think he had better have been kicking a football I can only say that I
wholly agree with them. For at the end of a time that under his influence I
had quite ceased to measure, I started up with a strange sense of having
literally slept at my post. It was after luncheon, <font color=maroon>and by
the schoolroom fire,</font> and yet I hadn’t really, in the least,
slept: I had only done something much worse—I had forgotten. Where, all this
time, was Flora? When I put the question to
Miles, he played on <font color=Olive>a
minute</font> before answering and then could only say: <font color=Goldenrod>“Why, my dear, how do <em>I</em> know?”</font> —breaking moreover into a
happy laugh which, immediately after, as if it were a vocal accompaniment,
he prolonged into incoherent, extravagant song. I went straight to my room,
but his sister was not there; then, before going downstairs, <font color=magenta>I looked into several others.</font> As she was
nowhere about she would surely be with Mrs.
Grose, whom, in the comfort of that theory, I accordingly
proceeded in quest of. <font color=mistyrose>I found her where I had found
her the evening before,</font> but she met my quick challenge with blank,
scared ignorance. She had only supposed that, after the repast, I had
carried off both the children; as to which she was quite in her right, <font color=magenta>for it was the very first time I had allowed the
little girl out of my sight</font> without some special provision. Of
course now indeed she might be with the maids, so that the immediate thing
was <font color=magenta>to look for her</font> without an air of
alarm. This we promptly arranged between us; but when, <font color=Olive>ten minutes
later</font> and in pursuance of our arrangement, we met in the hall, it
was only to report on either side that after guarded inquiries we had
altogether failed to trace her. For <font color=Olive>a minute</font> there, <font color=magenta>apart from observation,</font>
<font color=sienna>we exchanged mute alarms,</font> and I could feel
with what high interest my friend returned me all those I had from the first
given her.</div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“She’ll be
above,”</font> she presently said— <font color=Periwinkle>“in one of the rooms you haven’t searched.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“No; she’s at a
distance.”</font> I had made up my mind. <font color=Indigo>“She has gone out.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>
<font color=magenta>Mrs. Grose
stared.</font>seg> <font color=Periwinkle>“Without a hat?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=7><sup>¶7</sup>
<font color=magenta>I naturally also looked volumes.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“Isn’t that woman
always without one?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=8><sup>¶8</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“She’s with <em>her?</em>”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=9><sup>¶9</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“She’s with <em>her!</em>”</font></font> I declared. <font color=Indigo>“We
must find them.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=10><sup>¶10</sup>
<font color=teal>My hand was on my friend’s arm, but she failed for
the moment, confronted with such an account of the matter, to respond to
my pressure.</font> She communed, on the contrary, on the spot, with her
uneasiness. <font color=Periwinkle>“And
where’s Master Miles?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=11><sup>¶11</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Oh, <em>he’s</em> with Quint. They’re in the schoolroom.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=12><sup>¶12</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Lord, miss!”</font> My
view, I was myself aware—and therefore I suppose my tone—had never yet
reached so calm an assurance.</div><div class=paragraph n=13><sup>¶13</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“The trick’s
played,”</font> I went on; <font color=Indigo>“they’ve successfully worked their plan. He found the
most divine little way to keep me quiet while she went off.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=14><sup>¶14</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=mistyrose>“‘Divine’?”</font></font>
<font color=mistyrose>Mrs. Grose
bewilderedly echoed.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=15><sup>¶15</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Infernal,
then!”</font> I almost cheerfully rejoined. <font color=Periwinkle>“He has provided for himself as well.
But come!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=16><sup>¶16</sup>
<font color=magenta>She had helplessly gloomed at the upper
regions.</font>

<font color=Indigo>“So long with Quint? Yes—I don’t mind that now.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=18><sup>¶18</sup>She always ended, at these moments, <font color=teal>by getting
possession of my hand,</font> and in this manner she could at present
still stay me. But after gasping an instant at my sudden resignation, <font color=Periwinkle><font color=bisque>“Because of your letter?”</font></font> she eagerly brought out.</div><div class=paragraph n=19><sup>¶19</sup>I quickly, by way of answer, <font color=bisque>felt for my letter, drew it
forth, held it up,</font> and then, freeing myself, went and laid it on
the great hall table.</div><div class=paragraph n=20><sup>¶20</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Luke will take
it,”</font> I said as I came back. I reached the house door and opened
it; I was already on the steps.</div><div class=paragraph n=21><sup>¶21</sup>My companion still demurred: <font color=lightpink>the storm of the night and
<font color=GreenYellow>the early morning</font> had dropped, but <font color=Olive>the
afternoon</font> was damp and gray.</font> I came down to the drive
while she stood in the doorway. <font color=Periwinkle>“You go with nothing on?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=22><sup>¶22</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“What do I care when
the child has <font color=mistyrose>nothing?</font>? I can’t wait to
dress,”</font> I cried, <font color=Indigo>“and if you must do so, I leave you. Try meanwhile,
yourself, upstairs.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=23><sup>¶23</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“With <em>them?</em>”</font> Oh, on this, the poor woman
promptly joined me!</div></div><div class=chapter n=19><h3>Chapter: 19</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>We went straight to the lake, as it was called at Bly, and I daresay rightly called, <font color=magenta><font color=magenta>though I reflect that it may in fact
have been a sheet of water less remarkable than it appeared to my
untraveled eyes.</font></font> My acquaintance with sheets of water
was small, and the pool of Bly, at all events on the few occasions of my consenting, under the
protection of my pupils, to affront its surface in the old flat-bottomed
boat moored there for our use, had impressed me both with its extent and its
agitation. The usual place of embarkation was half a mile from the house,
but I had an intimate conviction that, wherever Flora might be, she was not near home. She had not given me
the slip for any small adventure, and, since the day of the very great one
that I had shared with her by the pond, I had been aware, in our walks, of
the quarter to which she most inclined. This was why I had now given to
Mrs. Grose’s steps so marked <font color=mistyrose>a direction—a direction</font> that made her, <font color=magenta>when she perceived it, oppose a resistance that
showed me she was freshly mystified.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“You’re going to the
water, Miss?—you think she’s <em>in</em>—?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“She may be, though the
depth is, I believe, nowhere very great. But what I judge most likely is
that she’s on the spot from which, the other day, <font color=magenta>we saw together what I told you.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=magenta>“When she pretended not to see—?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“With that astounding
self-possession? I’ve always been sure she wanted to go back alone. And
now her brother has managed it for her.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>Mrs. Grose still stood where she had
stopped. <font color=Periwinkle>“You suppose
they really <em>talk</em> of them?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“I could meet this with
a confidence! They say things that, if we heard them, would simply
appall us.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=7><sup>¶7</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“And if she <em>is</em> there—”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=8><sup>¶8</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Yes?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=9><sup>¶9</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Then Miss Jessel is?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=10><sup>¶10</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Beyond a doubt. <font color=magenta>You shall see.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=11><sup>¶11</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Oh, thank you!”</font>
my friend cried, planted so firm that, taking it in, I went straight on
without her. By the time I reached the pool, however, she was close behind
me, and I knew that, whatever, to her apprehension, might befall me, the
exposure of my society struck her as her least danger. <font color=sienna>She exhaled a moan of relief</font> as we at last
<font color=magenta>came in sight of the greater part of the
water without a sight of the child.</font>
<font color=magenta>There was no trace of Flora on that nearer side of the bank where my
observation of her had been most startling, and none on the opposite
edge, where, save for a margin of some twenty yards, a thick copse came
down to the water.</font> The pond, oblong in shape, had a width so
scant compared to its length that, with its ends out of view it might have
been taken for a scant river. <font color=magenta>We looked at the
empty expanse, and then I felt the suggestion of my friend’s eyes.</font> I knew what she meant and I replied with a negative headshake.</div><div class=paragraph n=12><sup>¶12</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“No, no;</font> wait! She has taken the boat.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=13><sup>¶13</sup>
<font color=magenta>My companion stared at the vacant mooring place
and then again across the lake.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Then where is
it?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=14><sup>¶14</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Our <font color=magenta>not seeing it</font> is the strongest of
proofs. She has used it to go over, and then has managed to hide it.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=15><sup>¶15</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“All alone—that
child?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=16><sup>¶16</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“She’s not alone, and at such times she’s not a
child:</font> she’s an old, old woman.”</font>
<font color=magenta>I scanned all the visible shore while Mrs. Grose
took again,</font> into the queer element I offered her, one of her
plunges of submission; then I pointed out that the boat might perfectly be
in a small refuge formed by one of the recesses of the pool, an indentation
masked, for the hither side, by a projection of the bank and by a clump of
trees growing close to the water.</div><div class=paragraph n=17><sup>¶17</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“But if the boat’s
there, where on earth’s <em>she?</em>”</font> my
colleague anxiously asked.</div><div class=paragraph n=18><sup>¶18</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“That’s exactly what we
must learn.”</font> And I started to walk further.</div><div class=paragraph n=19><sup>¶19</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“By going all the way
round?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=20><sup>¶20</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Certainly, far as it
is. It will take us but <font color=Olive>ten minutes</font>, but it’s far enough to
have made the child prefer not to walk. She went straight over.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=21><sup>¶21</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=mistyrose>“Laws!”</font></font> cried my friend again; the chain of my logic was ever too much for
her. It dragged her at my heels even now, and when we had got halfway
round—a devious, tiresome process, on ground much broken and by a path
choked with overgrowth— <font color=lightpink>I paused to give her breath.</font>
<font color=teal>I sustained her with a grateful arm,</font>
assuring her that she might hugely help me; and this started us afresh, so
that in the course of but few minutes more we reached a point from which we
found the boat to be where I had supposed it. <font color=magenta>It
had been intentionally left as much as possible out of sight</font> and
was tied to one of the stakes of a fence that came, just there, down to the
brink and that had been an assistance to disembarking. <font color=magenta>I recognized, as I looked at the pair of short,</font> thick oars, quite safely drawn up, the prodigious character of the
feat for a little girl; but I had lived, by this time, too long among
wonders and had panted to too many livelier measures. There was a gate in
the fence, through which we passed, and that brought us, after a trifling
interval, more into the open. Then, “There she is!” we both
exclaimed at once.</div><div class=paragraph n=22><sup>¶22</sup>Flora, a short way off, stood before us on
the grass and smiled as if her performance was now complete. The next thing
she did, however, was to stoop straight down and pluck—quite as if it were
all she was there for—a big, ugly spray of withered fern. I instantly became
sure she had just come out of the copse. She waited for us, not herself
taking a step, and I was conscious of the rare solemnity with which we
presently approached her. <font color=magenta>She smiled and
smiled,</font> and we met; <font color=sienna>but it was all done
in a silence by this time flagrantly ominous. </font>Mrs. Grose was the first to break the
spell: she threw herself on her knees and, <font color=teal>drawing
the child to her breast, clasped in a long embrace the little tender,
yielding body.</font>
<font color=magenta>While this dumb convulsion lasted I could only
watch it—which I did the more intently when I saw Flora’s face peep at me over our companion’s shoulder.</font> It was serious now—the flicker had left it; but it strengthened the
pang with which I at that moment envied Mrs.
Grose the simplicity of <em>her</em>
relation. Still, all this while, nothing more passed between us save that
Flora had let her foolish fern again
drop to the ground. <font color=Indigo><font color=Green>What she and I had
virtually said to each other was that pretexts were useless now.</font></font>
<font color=teal>When Mrs.
Grose finally got up she kept the child’s hand,</font> so
that the two were still before me; and the singular reticence of our
communion was even more marked <font color=magenta>in the frank look
she launched me.</font>
<font color=Green>“I’ll be hanged,”</font> it said, <font color=Green>“if <em>I’ll </em>speak!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=23><sup>¶23</sup>It was Flora who, <font color=magenta>gazing all over me in candid wonder,</font> was the first.</div><div class=paragraph n=24><sup>¶24</sup>
<font color=magenta>She was struck with our bareheaded aspect.</font>
<font color=Green>“Why, where are
your things?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=25><sup>¶25</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Where yours are,</font> my dear!”</font> I
promptly returned.</div><div class=paragraph n=26><sup>¶26</sup>She had already got back her gaiety, and appeared to take this as an answer
quite sufficient. <font color=Green>“And where’s Miles?”</font> she went
on.</div><div class=paragraph n=27><sup>¶27</sup>There was something in the small valor of it that quite finished me: these
three words from her were, <font color=magenta>in a flash like the
glitter of a drawn blade,</font>
<font color=teal>the jostle of the cup that my hand, for
<font color=GreenYellow>weeks</font> and <font color=GreenYellow>weeks</font>, had held high and full to
the brim that now, even before speaking, I felt overflow in a deluge.</font>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“I’ll tell you if you’ll tell <em>me</em>—”</font></font>
<font color=sienna>I heard myself say, then heard the tremor in which
it broke.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=28><sup>¶28</sup>
<font color=Green>“Well, what?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=29><sup>¶29</sup>
<font color=maroon>Mrs. Grose’s
suspense blazed at me</font>, but it was too late now, and I brought the
thing out handsomely. <font color=Indigo>“Where, my pet, is Miss
Jessel?”</font></div></div><div class=chapter n=20><h3>Chapter: 20</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>Just as in the churchyard with Miles, the
whole thing was upon us. <font color=sienna>Much as I had made of the
fact that this name had never once, between us, been sounded,</font>
<font color=magenta>the quick, smitten glare with which the child’s
face now received it</font> fairly likened <font color=sienna><font color=sienna>my breach of the silence to the smash of
a pane of glass.</font></font>
<font color=sienna>It added to the interposing cry, as if to stay the
blow, that Mrs. Grose, at the same
instant, uttered over my violence—the shriek of a creature scared, or
rather wounded, which, in turn, within <font color=Olive>a few seconds</font>, was
completed by a gasp of my own.</font>
<font color=teal>I seized my colleague’s arm.</font>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“She’s there, she’s there!”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>Miss Jessel stood before us on the
opposite bank exactly as she had stood the other time, and I remember,
strangely, as the first feeling now produced in me, my thrill of joy at
having brought on a proof. <font color=mistyrose>She was there, and I was
justified; she was there,</font> and I was neither cruel nor mad. <font color=mistyrose>She was there for poor scared Mrs. Grose, but she was there most for Flora;</font> and no moment of my monstrous
time was perhaps so extraordinary as that in which I consciously threw out
to her—with the sense that, pale and ravenous demon as she was, <font color=teal>she would catch and understand it</font>—an
inarticulate message of gratitude. She rose erect on the spot my friend and
I had lately quitted, and there was not, <font color=teal>in all
the long reach of her desire, an inch of her evil that fell short.</font>
<font color=magenta>This first vividness of vision and emotion were
things of <font color=Olive>a few secondsa</font>, during which Mrs. Grose’s dazed blink across to where I
pointed struck me as a sovereign sign that she too at last saw, just as
it carried my own eyes precipitately to the child.</font> The revelation
then of the manner in which Flora was
affected startled me, in truth, far more than it would have done to find her
also merely agitated, for direct dismay was of course not what I had
expected. Prepared and on her guard as our pursuit had actually made her,
she would repress every betrayal; <font color=teal>and I was
therefore shaken,</font> on the spot, <font color=magenta>by my
first glimpse</font> of the particular one for which I had not allowed.
<font color=magenta>To see her, without a convulsion of her small
<font color=pink>pink</font> face,</font> not even feign to
glance in the direction of the prodigy I announced, but only, instead of
that, turn at <em>me</em>
<font color=magenta>an expression of hard, still gravity, an
expression absolutely new and unprecedented and that appeared to read
and accuse and judge me</font> —this was a stroke that somehow converted
the little girl herself into the very presence that could make me quail.
<font color=magenta>I quailed even though my certitude that she
thoroughly saw</font> was never greater than at that instant, and in the
immediate need to defend myself I called it passionately to witness. <font color=Indigo>“She’s there, you little
unhappy thing— <font color=mistyrose>there, there, <em>there</em>, and you see her as well as you see me!”</font></font> I had said shortly before to Mrs.
Grose that she was not at these times a child, but an old,
old woman, and that description of her could not have been more strikingly
confirmed than in the way in which, for all answer to this, <font color=magenta>she simply showed me, without a concession, an
admission, of her eyes, a countenance of deeper and deeper, of indeed
suddenly quite fixed, reprobation.</font> I was by this time—if I can
put the whole thing at all together—more appalled at what I may properly
call her manner than at anything else, though it was simultaneously with
this that I became aware of having Mrs.
Grose also, and very formidably, to reckon with. My elder
companion, the next moment, at any rate, <font color=mistyrose>blotted out
everything but her own flushed face</font>
<font color=sienna>and her loud, shocked protest, a burst of high
disapproval.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“What a dreadful turn,
to be sure, miss! <font color=magenta>Where on earth do you see
anything?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>
<font color=teal>I could only grasp her more quickly yet,</font>
for even while she spoke the hideous plain presence stood undimmed and
undaunted. It had already lasted <font color=Olive>a minute</font>, and it lasted while
I continued, <font color=teal>seizing my colleague, quite thrusting
her at it and presenting her to it, to insist with my pointing hand.</font>
<font color=Indigo><font color=magenta><font color=mistyrose>“You don’t see her exactly as <em>we</em> see?—you mean to say you don’t
now—<em>now?</em> She’s as big as a <font color=maroon>blazing fire!</font> Only look,
dearest woman, <em>look</em>—!”</font></font></font>
<font color=magenta>She looked,</font> even as I did, and gave me,
<font color=sienna>with her deep groan of negation, repulsion,
compassion</font>—the mixture with her pity of her relief at her
exemption—a sense, <font color=teal>touching to me even then,
that she would have backed me up if she could.</font> I might well have
needed that, for with this hard blow of the proof that <font color=magenta>her
eyes were hopelessly sealed</font> I felt my own situation horribly
crumble, I felt—<font color=magenta>I saw</font>—my livid predecessor
press, from her position, on my defeat, and I was conscious, more than all,
of what I should have from this instant to deal with in the astounding
little attitude of Flora. <font color=teal>Into this attitude Mrs.
Grose immediately and violently entered, breaking, even
while there pierced through my sense of ruin a prodigious private
triumph, into breathless reassurance.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=magenta>“She isn’t there, little lady, and nobody’s
there—and you never see nothing,</font> my sweet! How can poor
Miss Jessel—when poor
Miss Jessel’s dead and buried?</font>
<font color=Periwinkle><em>We</em> know, don’t we, love?”</font> —and she
appealed, blundering in, to the child. <font color=Periwinkle>“It’s all a mere mistake and a worry and a joke—and
we’ll go home as fast as we can!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>Our companion, on this, had responded with a strange, quick primness of
propriety, and they were again, with Mrs.
Grose on her feet, united, as it were, in pained opposition
to me. <font color=magenta>Flora
continued to fix me with her small mask of reprobation,</font> and even
at <font color=Olive>that minute</font> I prayed God to forgive me for<font color=magenta>seeming to see that,</font> as she stood there <font color=teal>holding tight to our friend’s dress,</font> her
incomparable childish beauty had suddenly failed, had quite vanished. I’ve
said it already—she was literally, she was hideously, hard; she had turned
common and almost ugly. <font color=Green>“I
don’t know what you mean. <font color=mistyrose>I see nobody. I see
nothing.</font> I never <em>have</em>. I think
you’re cruel. I don’t like you!”</font> Then, after this deliverance,
which might have been that of a vulgarly pert little girl in the street, she
<font color=teal>hugged Mrs.
Grose more closely and buried in her skirts the dreadful
little face.</font>
<font color=sienna>In this position she produced an almost furious
wail.</font>
<font color=Green><font color=mistyrose>“Take me away, take me away—oh, take me away from
<em>her!</em>”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“From <em>me?</em>”</font></font> I panted.</div><div class=paragraph n=7><sup>¶7</sup>
<font color=Green><font color=mistyrose>“From you—from you!”</font></font> she cried.</div><div class=paragraph n=8><sup>¶8</sup>Even Mrs. Grose<font color=magenta>looked across at me dismayed,</font> while I had
nothing to do but communicate again with the figure that, on the opposite
bank, without a movement, as rigidly still <font color=teal>as if
catching, beyond the interval, our voices,</font> was as vividly there
for my disaster as it was not there for my service. The wretched child had
spoken exactly as if she had got from some outside source each of her
stabbing little words, and I could therefore, in the full despair of all I
had to accept, but sadly shake my head at her. <font color=Indigo>“If I had ever doubted, all my doubt would
at present have gone. I’ve been living with the miserable truth, and now
it has only too much closed round me. Of course I’ve lost you: I’ve
interfered, and you’ve seen— <font color=lime><font color=purple>under
<em>her</em> dictation”</font></font>
</font>—with which I faced, over the pool again, our infernal witness—
<font color=Indigo>“the easy and perfect
way to meet it. I’ve done my best, but I’ve lost you. Goodbye.”</font>
For Mrs. Grose I had an imperative, an
almost frantic <font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Go, go!”</font></font> before which, in infinite distress, <font color=magenta>but
mutely possessed of the little girl and clearly convinced, in spite of
her blindness,</font> that something awful had occurred and some
collapse engulfed us, she retreated, by the way we had come, as fast as she
could move.</div><div class=paragraph n=9><sup>¶9</sup>Of what first happened when I was left alone I had no subsequent memory. I
only knew that at the end of, I suppose, a quarter of an hour, <font color=teal>an odorous dampness and roughness, chilling and
piercing my trouble, had made me understand that I must have thrown
myself, on my face, on the ground and given way to a wildness of grief.</font> I must have lain there long and cried and sobbed, for when I raised
my head <font color=GreenYellow>the day</font> was almost done.<font color=magenta>I
got up and looked a moment, through the twilight,</font> at the <font color=gray>gray pool</font> and its blank, haunted edge, and then
I took, back to the house, my dreary and difficult course. When I reached
the gate in the fence the boat, to my surprise, was gone, so that I had a
fresh reflection to make on Flora’s
extraordinary command of the situation. She passed that night, by the most
tacit, and I should add, were not the word so grotesque a false note, the
happiest of arrangements, with Mrs.
Grose. <font color=magenta><font color=mistyrose>I saw neither of them on my return, but, on the
other hand, as by an ambiguous compensation, I saw a great deal of
Miles.</font></font>
<font color=magenta><font color=mistyrose>I saw</font></font> —I can use no other phrase—so much of him that it was as if it were
more than it had ever been. No evening I had passed at Bly had the portentous quality of this one; <font color=mistyrose>in spite of which—and in spite also of</font> the deeper depths of
consternation that had opened beneath my feet—there was literally, in the
ebbing actual, an extraordinarily <font color=darkgreen>sweet
sadness.</font> On reaching the house <font color=magenta>I had
never so much as looked for the boy;</font> I had simply gone straight
to my room to change what I was wearing and to take in, <font color=magenta>at a glance,</font> much material testimony to
Flora’s rupture. Her little belongings
had all been removed. <font color=maroon>When later, by the schoolroom fire,</font> I was served with tea by the usual maid, I indulged, on the article
of my other pupil, in no inquiry whatever. He had his freedom now—<font color=mistyrose>he might have it to the end! Well, he did have it;</font> and it consisted—in part at least—of his coming in at <font color=Olive>about eight o’clock</font> and sitting down with me in
silence. On the removal of the tea things <font color=maroon>I had blown out
the candles</font> and drawn my chair closer: I was conscious of a
mortal coldness and felt as if I should never again be warm. <font color=magenta>So, when he appeared,</font>
<font color=maroon>I was sitting in the glow with my thoughts.</font> He paused
a moment by the door <font color=magenta>as if to look at me;</font>
then—as if to share them—<font color=maroon>came to the other side of the
hearth</font> and sank into a chair. We sat there in absolute stillness;
yet he wanted, I felt, to be with me.</div></div><div class=chapter n=21><h3>Chapter: 21</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>Before <font color=GreenYellow>a new day</font>, in my room, had fully broken, <font color=magenta>my eyes opened to Mrs.
Grose,</font> who had come to my bedside with worse news.
Flora was so markedly feverish that an
illness was perhaps at hand; she had passed a <font color=Olive>night</font> of extreme
unrest, a night agitated above all by fears that had for their subject not
in the least her former, but wholly
her present, governess. It was not
against the possible re-entrance of Miss
Jessel on the scene that she protested—it was conspicuously
and passionately against mine. I was promptly on my feet of course, and with
an immense deal to ask; the more that my friend had discernibly now girded
her loins to meet me once more. This I felt as soon as I had put to her the
question of her sense of the child’s sincerity as against my own. <font color=Indigo>“She persists in denying
to you that she saw, or has ever seen, anything?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>My visitor’s trouble, truly, was great. <font color=Periwinkle>“Ah, miss, it isn’t a matter on which I can push her!
Yet it isn’t either, I must say, as if I much needed to. It has made
her, every inch of her, quite old.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=magenta>“Oh, I see her perfectly from here.</font> She
resents, for all the world like some high little personage, the
imputation on her truthfulness and, as it were, her respectability.
‘Miss Jessel
indeed—<em>she!</em>’ <font color=mistyrose>Ah, she’s ‘respectable,’</font> the chit! The impression she gave me there <font color=GreenYellow>yesterday</font>
was, I assure you, the very strangest of all; it was quite beyond any of
the others. I <em>did</em> put my foot in it! She’ll
never speak to me again.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>Hideous and obscure as it all was, <font color=teal>it held</font>
<font color=sienna>Mrs. Grose
briefly silent;</font> then she granted my point with a frankness which,
I made sure, had more behind it. <font color=Periwinkle>“I think indeed, miss, she never will. She do have a
grand manner about it!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“And that <font color=mistyrose>manner”</font></font> —I summed it up— <font color=Indigo>“is practically what’s the matter with her now!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>
<font color=mistyrose>Oh, that manner,</font>
<font color=magenta>I could see in my visitor’s face,</font> and not a
little else besides! <font color=Periwinkle>“She asks me every <font color=Olive>three minutes</font> if I think you’re coming
in.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=7><sup>¶7</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“I see—I see.”</font></font> I, too, on my side, had so much more than worked it out.</div><div class=paragraph n=8><sup>¶8</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Has she said to you
since <font color=GreenYellow>yesterday</font>—except to repudiate her familiarity with
anything so dreadful—a single other word about Miss Jessel?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=9><sup>¶9</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Not one, miss. And of
course you know,”</font> my friend added, <font color=Periwinkle>“I took it from her, by the lake, that,
just then and there at least, there <em>was</em>
nobody.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=10><sup>¶10</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Rather! and,
naturally, you take it from her still.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=11><sup>¶11</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“I don’t contradict
her. What else can I do?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=12><sup>¶12</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Nothing in the world!
You’ve the cleverest little person to deal with. They’ve made them—their
two friends, I mean—still cleverer even than nature did; for it was
wondrous material to play on! Flora has
now her grievance, and she’ll work it to the end.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=13><sup>¶13</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Yes, miss; but to
<em>what</em>
<font color=mistyrose>end?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=14><sup>¶14</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Why, that of dealing
with me to her uncle. She’ll make me out to him the lowest creature—!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=15><sup>¶15</sup>I winced <font color=magenta><font color=magenta>at the fair
show of the scene in Mrs.
Grose’s face; she looked for <font color=Olive>a minute</font> as if
she sharply saw them together.</font></font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“And him who thinks so
well of you!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=16><sup>¶16</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“He has an odd way—it
comes over me now,”</font> I laughed, <font color=Indigo>“—of proving it! But that doesn’t matter.
What Flora wants, of course, is to get
rid of me.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=17><sup>¶17</sup>My companion bravely concurred. <font color=Periwinkle><font color=magenta>“Never again to so much as look at
you.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=18><sup>¶18</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“So that what you’ve
come to me now for,”</font> I asked, <font color=Indigo>“is to speed me on my way?”</font> Before she had
time to reply, however, I had her in check.</div><div class=paragraph n=19><sup>¶19</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“I’ve a better
idea—<font color=magenta>the result of my reflections.</font> My going <em>would</em> seem the right thing,
and on <font color=GreenYellow>Sunday</font> I was terribly near it. Yet that won’t do.
<font color=mistyrose>It’s <em>you</em> who must
go. You must take Flora.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=20><sup>¶20</sup>My visitor, at this, did speculate. <font color=Periwinkle>“But where in the world—?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=21><sup>¶21</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose><font color=mistyrose>“Away from here. Away from <em>them</em>. Away, even most of all, now,
from me.</font></font> Straight to her uncle.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=22><sup>¶22</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Only to tell on
you—?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=23><sup>¶23</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“No, not <font color=mistyrose>‘only’!</font> To leave me, in addition, with my remedy.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=24><sup>¶24</sup>She was still vague. <font color=Periwinkle>“And what <em>is</em> your remedy?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=25><sup>¶25</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Your loyalty, to begin
with. And then Miles’s.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=26><sup>¶26</sup>
<font color=magenta>She looked at me hard.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=mediumpurple>“Do you think he—?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=27><sup>¶27</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Won’t, if he has the
chance, turn on me? Yes, I venture still to think it. At all events, I
want to try. Get off with his sister as soon as possible and leave me
with him alone.”</font> I was amazed, myself, at the spirit I had still
in reserve, and therefore perhaps a trifle the more disconcerted at the way
in which, in spite of this fine example of it, <font color=lightpink>she
hesitated.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“There’s one thing, of
course,”</font> I went on: <font color=Indigo><font color=magenta>“they mustn’t, before she goes, see each
other for <font color=Olive>three seconds</font>.”</font></font> Then it came over me that, in spite of Flora’s presumable sequestration from the instant of her
return from the pool, it might already be too late.</div><div class=paragraph n=28><sup>¶28</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Do you mean,”</font> I
anxiously asked, <font color=Indigo>“that
they <em>have</em> met?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=29><sup>¶29</sup>
<font color=magenta>At this she quite flushed.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Ah, miss, I’m not such
a fool as that! If I’ve been obliged to leave her three or four times,
it has been each time with one of the maids, and at present, though
she’s alone, she’s locked in safe. <font color=mistyrose>And yet—and
yet!”</font></font> There were too many things.</div><div class=paragraph n=30><sup>¶30</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“And yet what?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=31><sup>¶31</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Well, are you so sure
of the little gentleman?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=32><sup>¶32</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“I’m not sure of
anything but <em>you</em>. But I have, since last
evening, a new hope. I think he wants to give me an opening. I do
believe that—poor little exquisite wretch!—he wants to speak. Last
evening, <font color=maroon>in the firelight</font>
<font color=sienna>and the silence,</font> he sat with me for two
hours as if it were just coming.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=33><sup>¶33</sup>
<font color=magenta>Mrs. Grose
looked hard, through the window, at the <font color=gray>gray,</font> gathering <font color=GreenYellow>day</font>.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=34><sup>¶34</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“And did it
come?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=35><sup>¶35</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“No, though <font color=mistyrose>I waited and waited,</font> I confess it didn’t,
<font color=sienna>and it was without a breach of the
silence</font> or so much as a faint allusion to his sister’s
condition and absence that <font color=teal>we at last kissed
for good <font color=Olive>night</font>.</font> All the same,”</font> I
continued, <font color=Indigo>“I can’t,
<font color=magenta>if her uncle sees her, consent to his
seeing her brother</font> without my having given the boy—and most
of all because things have got so bad—a little more time.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=36><sup>¶36</sup>My friend appeared on this ground more reluctant than I could quite
understand. <font color=Periwinkle>“What do
you mean by <font color=mistyrose>more time?</font>”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=37><sup>¶37</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Well, a day or
two—really to bring it out. He’ll then be on <em>my</em> side—<font color=magenta>of which you see the
importance.</font> If nothing comes, I shall only fail, and you
will, at the worst, have helped me by doing, on your arrival in town,
whatever you may have found possible.”</font> So I put it before her,
but she continued for a little so inscrutably embarrassed that I came again
to her aid. <font color=Indigo>“Unless,
indeed,”</font> I wound up, <font color=Indigo>“you really want <em>not</em> to
go.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=38><sup>¶38</sup>
<font color=magenta>I could see it, in her face, at last clear
itself;</font>
<font color=teal>she put out her hand to me as a pledge.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=mistyrose>“I’ll go—I’ll go. I’ll go</font>
<font color=Olive>this morning</font>.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=39><sup>¶39</sup>I wanted to be very just. <font color=Indigo>“If you <em>should</em> wish still
to wait, <font color=magenta>I would engage she shouldn’t see
me.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=40><sup>¶40</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=mistyrose>“No, no:</font> it’s the place itself. She must
leave it.”</font>
<font color=teal>She held me</font>
<font color=magenta>a moment with heavy eyes,</font> then brought out
the rest. <font color=Periwinkle><font color=mediumpurple>“Your idea’s the right one. I myself,
miss—”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=41><sup>¶41</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Well?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=42><sup>¶42</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“I can’t
stay.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=43><sup>¶43</sup>
<font color=magenta>The look she gave me with it made me jump at
possibilities.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“You mean that, since
<font color=GreenYellow>yesterday</font>, <font color=magenta>you <em>have</em> seen—?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=44><sup>¶44</sup>She shook her head with dignity. <font color=Periwinkle>“I’ve <em>heard</em>—!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=45><sup>¶45</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Heard?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=46><sup>¶46</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“From that
child—horrors! There!”</font>
<font color=sienna>she sighed with tragic relief.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“On my honor, miss, she
says things—!”</font> But at this evocation she broke down; she
dropped, with a sudden sob, upon my sofa and, <font color=magenta>as
I had seen her do before,</font> gave way to all the grief of it.</div><div class=paragraph n=47><sup>¶47</sup>It was quite in another manner that I, for my part, let myself go. <font color=Indigo>“Oh, thank
God!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=48><sup>¶48</sup>She sprang up again at this, drying her eyes <font color=sienna>with a
groan.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=mistyrose>“‘Thank God’?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=49><sup>¶49</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“It so justifies
me!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=50><sup>¶50</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“It does that,
miss!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=51><sup>¶51</sup>I couldn’t have desired more emphasis, <font color=lightpink>but I just
hesitated.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“She’s so
horrible?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=52><sup>¶52</sup>
<font color=magenta>I saw my colleague scarce knew how to put
it.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Really
shocking.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=53><sup>¶53</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“And about
me?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=54><sup>¶54</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=mistyrose>“About you, miss</font> —since you must have it. It’s beyond
everything, for a young lady; and I can’t think wherever she must have
picked up—”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=55><sup>¶55</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“The appalling language
she applied to me? I can, then!”</font>
<font color=sienna>I broke in with a laugh</font> that was doubtless
significant enough.</div><div class=paragraph n=56><sup>¶56</sup>It only, in truth, left my friend still more grave. <font color=Periwinkle>“Well, perhaps I ought to also—since
I’ve heard some of it before! Yet I can’t bear it,”</font> the poor
woman went on while, with the same movement, <font color=magenta>she
glanced, on my dressing table, at the face of my watch.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“But I must go
back.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=57><sup>¶57</sup>I kept her, however. <font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose><font color=mediumpurple>“Ah, if you can’t bear it—!”</font></font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=58><sup>¶58</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“How can I stop with
her, you mean? Why, just <em>for</em> that: to get
her away. Far from this,”</font> she pursued, <font color=Periwinkle><font color=mistyrose>“far from <em>them</em>—”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=59><sup>¶59</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“She may be different? She may be</font> free?”</font>
<font color=teal>I seized her</font> almost with joy.</div><div class=paragraph n=60><sup>¶60</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Then, in spite of
<font color=GreenYellow>yesterday</font>, you <em>believe</em>—”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=61><sup>¶61</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“In such
doings?”</font> Her simple description of them required, <font color=magenta>in the light of her expression,</font> to be
carried no further, and she gave me the whole thing as she had never done.
<font color=Periwinkle>“I
believe.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=62><sup>¶62</sup>Yes, it was a joy, and we were still shoulder to shoulder: if I might
continue sure of that I should care but little what else happened. My
support in the presence of disaster would be the same as it had been in my
early need of confidence, and if my friend would answer for my honesty, I
would <font color=mistyrose>answer for</font> all the rest. On the point of
taking leave of her, nonetheless, I was to some extent embarrassed. <font color=Indigo>“There’s one thing, of
course—it occurs to me—to remember. <font color=bisque>My letter, giving
the alarm, will have reached town before you.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=63><sup>¶63</sup>I now perceived still more how she had been beating about the bush and how
weary at last it had made her. <font color=Periwinkle><font color=bisque>“Your letter won’t have got there. Your letter never
went.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=64><sup>¶64</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“What then became of
it?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=65><sup>¶65</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Goodness knows! Master
Miles—”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=66><sup>¶66</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Do you mean <em>he</em> took it?”</font> I gasped.</div><div class=paragraph n=67><sup>¶67</sup>
<font color=maroon>She hung fire,</font> but she overcame her
reluctance. <font color=Periwinkle><font color=magenta>“I mean that I saw <font color=GreenYellow>yesterday</font>,</font> when I came back with Miss Flora, that it wasn’t where you had put it. <font color=Olive>Later in
the evening</font> I had the chance to question Luke, and he
declared that he had neither noticed nor touched it.”</font>
<font color=sienna>We could only exchange, on this, one of our
deeper mutual soundings, and it was Mrs.
Grose who first brought up the plumb with an almost
elated</font>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=magenta>“You see!”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=68><sup>¶68</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=magenta>“Yes, I see</font> that if Miles took it instead he probably will have
<font color=lime>read it and destroyed it.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=69><sup>¶69</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=magenta>“And don’t you see anything else?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=70><sup>¶70</sup>
<font color=magenta>I faced her a moment with a sad smile.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“It strikes me that by
this time <font color=magenta>your eyes are open even wider
than mine.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=71><sup>¶71</sup>They proved to be so indeed, <font color=magenta>but she could still
blush, almost, to show it.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle>“I make out now what he
must have done at school.”</font> And she gave, in her simple
sharpness, an almost droll disillusioned nod. <font color=Periwinkle>“He stole!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=72><sup>¶72</sup>I turned it over—I tried to be more judicial. <font color=Indigo>“Well—perhaps.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=73><sup>¶73</sup>
<font color=magenta>She looked as if she found me unexpectedly
calm.</font>
<font color=Periwinkle><font color=bisque>“He stole <em>letters!</em>”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=74><sup>¶74</sup>She couldn’t know my reasons for a calmness after all pretty shallow; <font color=magenta>so I showed them off as I might.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“I hope then it was to
more purpose than in this case! The note, at any rate, that I put on the
table <font color=GreenYellow>yesterday</font>,”</font> I pursued, <font color=Indigo>“will have given him so scant an
advantage—for it contained only the bare demand for an interview—that he
is already much ashamed of having gone so far for so little, and that
what he had on his mind <font color=GreenYellow>last evening</font> was precisely the need
of confession.”</font> I seemed to myself, for the instant, to have
mastered it, <font color=magenta>to see it all.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=75><sup>¶75</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Leave us, leave us”</font></font> —I was already, at the door, hurrying her off.</div><div class=paragraph n=76><sup>¶76</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“I’ll get it out of
him. He’ll meet me— <font color=mistyrose>he’ll confess. If he
confesses, he’s saved. And if he’s saved—”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=77><sup>¶77</sup>
<font color=Periwinkle>“Then <em>you</em> are?”</font> The dear woman <font color=teal>kissed me</font> on this, and I took her farewell.
<font color=Periwinkle>“I’ll save you
without him!”</font> she cried as she went.</div></div><div class=chapter n=22><h3>Chapter: 22</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>Yet it was when she had got off—and I missed her on the spot—<font color=teal>that the great pinch</font> really came. If I had
counted on what it would give me to find myself alone with Miles, <font color=magenta>I speedily
perceived, at least, that it would give me a measure.</font> No
<font color=Olive>hour</font> of my stay in fact was so assailed with apprehensions
as that of my coming down to learn that the carriage containing Mrs. Grose and my younger pupil had already
rolled out of the gates. Now I <em>was</em>, I said to
myself, face to face with the elements, and for much of the rest of
<font color=GreenYellow>the day</font>, while I fought my weakness, I could consider that
I had been supremely rash. It was a tighter place still than I had yet
turned round in; all the more that, for the first time, <font color=magenta>I could see in the aspect of others a confused
reflection of the crisis.</font>
<font color=magenta>What had happened naturally caused them all to
stare;</font> there was too little of the explained, throw out whatever
we might, in the suddenness of my colleague’s act. <font color=magenta>The maids and the men looked blank;</font> the
effect of which on my nerves was an aggravation <font color=magenta>until I saw the necessity of making it a positive aid.</font>
<font color=teal>It was precisely, in short, by just clutching
the helm that I avoided total wreck;</font> and I dare say that, to bear
up at all, I became, that morning, very grand and very dry. I welcomed the
consciousness that I was charged with much to do, and I caused it to be
known as well that, left thus to myself, I was quite remarkably firm. I
wandered with that manner, for <font color=Olive>the next hour</font> or two, all over
the place and <font color=magenta>looked,</font> I have no doubt, as
if I were ready for any onset. So, for the benefit of whom it might concern,
I paraded with a sick heart.</div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>The person it appeared least to concern proved to be, till dinner, little
Miles himself. My perambulations had
given me, meanwhile, <font color=magenta>no glimpse of him,</font>
but they had tended to make more public the change taking place in our
relation as a consequence of his having at the piano, <font color=GreenYellow>the day
before</font>, kept me, in Flora’s
interest, so beguiled and befooled. The stamp of publicity had of course
been fully given by her confinement and departure, and the change itself was
now ushered in by our nonobservance of the regular custom of the schoolroom.
<font color=magenta>He had already disappeared when, on my way
down, I pushed open his door, and I learned below that he had
breakfasted—in the presence of a couple of the maids—with Mrs. Grose and his sister.</font> He had
then gone out, as he said, for a stroll; than which nothing, I reflected,
<font color=magenta>could better have expressed his frank view
of the abrupt transformation of my office.</font> What he would not
permit this office to consist of was yet to be settled: there was a queer
relief, at all events—I mean for myself in especial—in the renouncement of
one pretension. If so much had sprung to the surface, I scarce put it too
strongly in saying that what had perhaps <font color=mistyrose>sprung</font>
highest was the absurdity of our prolonging the fiction that I had anything
more to teach him. It sufficiently stuck out that, by tacit little tricks in
which even more than myself he carried out the care for my dignity, I had
had to appeal to him to let me off straining to meet him on the ground of
his true capacity. He had at any rate his freedom now; <font color=teal>I was never to touch it again;</font>
<font color=magenta>as I had amply shown,</font> moreover, when, on
his joining me in the schoolroom the <font color=GreenYellow>previous
<font color=Olive>night</font>
</font>, I had uttered, on the subject of the interval
just concluded, neither challenge nor hint. I had too much, from this
moment, my other ideas. Yet when he at last arrived, the difficulty of
applying them, the accumulations of my problem, were brought straight home
to me by the beautiful little presence on which what had occurred had as
yet, <font color=magenta>for the eye, dropped neither stain nor
shadow.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>To mark, for the house, the high state I cultivated I decreed that my meals
with the boy should be served, as we called it, downstairs; so that I had
been awaiting him in the ponderous pomp of the room outside of the window of
which I had had from Mrs. Grose, that
first scared <font color=GreenYellow>Sunday</font>, <font color=magenta>my flash of
something it would scarce have done to call light.</font> Here at
present I felt afresh—for I had felt it <font color=mistyrose>again and
again</font>seg>—how my equilibrium depended on the success of my rigid
<font color=mistyrose>will, the will</font>
<font color=magenta>to shut my eyes as tight as possible to the
truth</font> that what I had to deal with was, revoltingly, against
nature. I could only get on at all by taking “nature” into my confidence and
my account, by treating my monstrous ordeal <font color=teal>as a
push in a direction unusual,</font> of course, and unpleasant, but
demanding, after all, for a fair front, only another turn of the screw of
ordinary human virtue. No attempt, nonetheless, could well require more tact
than just this attempt to supply, one’s self, <em>all</em> the nature. How could I put even a little of that article
into a suppression of reference to what had occurred? How, on the other
hand, could I make <font color=mistyrose>reference</font> without a new
plunge into the hideous obscure? Well, a sort of answer, after a time, had
come to me, and it was so far confirmed as that I was met, incontestably,
<font color=magenta>by the quickened vision</font> of what was
rare in my little companion. It was indeed as if he had found even now—as he
had so often <font color=mistyrose>found</font> at lessons—still some other
delicate way to ease me off. Wasn’t there light in the fact which, as we
shared our solitude, broke out with a specious glitter it had never yet
quite worn?—the fact that (opportunity aiding, precious opportunity which
had now come) it would be preposterous, with a child so endowed, to forego
the help one might wrest from absolute intelligence? What had his
intelligence been given him for but to save him? <font color=teal>Mightn’t one, to reach his mind, risk the stretch of an angular arm
over his character?</font> It was as if, <font color=magenta>when
we were face to face in the dining room, he had literally shown me the
way.</font> The roast mutton was on the table, and I had dispensed with
attendance. Miles, before he sat down,
stood a moment with his hands in his pockets and looked at the joint, on
which he seemed on the point of passing some humorous judgment. But what he
presently produced was: <font color=Goldenrod>“I
say, my dear, is she really very awfully ill?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Little Flora? Not so bad but that she’ll presently
be better. London will set her up. Bly had ceased to agree with her. Come here and take your
mutton.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>He alertly obeyed me, carried the plate carefully to his seat, and, when he
was established, went on. <font color=Goldenrod><font color=mistyrose>“Did Bly disagree</font> with her so terribly suddenly?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Not so suddenly</font> as you might think. <font color=magenta>One had seen it coming on.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=7><sup>¶7</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Then why didn’t you get
her off before?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=8><sup>¶8</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Before</font> what?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=9><sup>¶9</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod><font color=mistyrose>“Before</font> she became too ill to travel.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=10><sup>¶10</sup>I found myself prompt. <font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“She’s <em>not</em> too ill to
travel:</font> she only might have become so if she had stayed. <font color=teal>This was just the moment to seize.</font> The
journey will dissipate the influence”</font> —oh, I was grand!— <font color=Indigo>“and carry it
off.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=11><sup>¶11</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod><font color=mistyrose>“I see, I see”</font>
</font>—Miles, for that matter, was grand,
too. He settled to his repast with the charming little “table manner” that,
from <font color=GreenYellow>the day</font> of his arrival, had relieved me of all grossness
of admonition. Whatever he had been driven from school for, it was not for
ugly feeding. He was irreproachable, as always, <font color=GreenYellow>today</font>; but he
was unmistakably more conscious. He was discernibly trying to take for
granted more things than he found, without assistance, quite easy; <font color=sienna>and he dropped into peaceful silence</font>, while
he felt his situation. Our meal was of the briefest—mine a vain pretense,
and I had the things immediately removed. While this was done Miles stood again with his hands in his little
pockets and his back to me—stood <font color=magenta>and looked out
of the wide window through which, that other day, I had seen what <font color=teal>pulled me up.</font></font>
<font color=sienna>We continued silent while the maid was with us—as
silent,</font>
<font color=royalblue>it whimsically occurred to me, as some young couple
who, on their wedding journey, at the inn, feel shy in the presence of
the waiter.</font> He turned round only when the waiter had left us.
<font color=Goldenrod>“Well—so we’re
alone!”</font></div></div><div class=chapter n=23><h3>Chapter: 23</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Oh, more or less.”</font>
<font color=magenta>I fancy my smile was pale.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“Not absolutely. We
shouldn’t like that!”</font> I went on.</div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“No—I suppose <font color=mistyrose>we shouldn’t.</font> Of course we have the others.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“We have the others—we have indeed the
others,”</font></font> I concurred.</div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Yet even though <font color=mistyrose>we have them,”</font></font> he returned, still with his hands in his pockets and planted there
in front of me, <font color=Goldenrod>“they
don’t much count, do they?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>I made the best of it, but I felt wan. <font color=Indigo>“It depends on what you call <font color=mistyrose>‘much’!”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Yes”</font>—with all
accommodation— <font color=Goldenrod>“everything
<font color=mistyrose>depends!”</font></font> On this, however, <font color=magenta>he faced to the window
again</font> and <font color=teal>presently reached it with
his vague, restless, cogitating step.</font> He remained there awhile,
with his forehead against the glass, in contemplation of the stupid shrubs I
knew and the dull things of <font color=GreenYellow>November</font>. I had always
my hypocrisy of “work,” behind which, now, I gained the sofa. Steadying
myself with it there as I had repeatedly done at those moments of torment
that I have described as the moments of my knowing the children to be given
to something from which I was barred, I sufficiently obeyed my habit of
being prepared for the worst. But an extraordinary impression dropped on me
as I extracted a meaning from the boy’s embarrassed back—none other than the
impression that I was not barred now. This inference grew in a <font color=Olive>few
minutes</font> to sharp intensity and seemed bound up with the direct
perception that it was positively <em>he</em> who was.
<font color=magenta>The frames and squares of the great window
were a kind of image,</font> for him, of a kind of failure. <font color=magenta>I felt that I saw him,</font> at any rate, shut in
or shut out. He was admirable, but not comfortable: I took it in with a
throb of hope. <font color=magenta>Wasn’t he looking, through the
haunted pane, for something he couldn’t see?</font>—and wasn’t it the
first time in the whole business that he had known such a lapse? <font color=mistyrose>The first, the very first:</font> I found it a splendid
portent. <font color=magenta>It made him anxious, though he watched
himself;</font> he had been anxious <font color=GreenYellow>all day</font> and, <font color=darkgreen>even while in his usual sweet little manner</font> he sat at table, had needed all his small strange genius <font color=lime>to give it a gloss.</font> When he at last turned round to
meet me, it was almost as if this genius had succumbed. <font color=Goldenrod>“Well, I think I’m glad Bly<font color=mistyrose>agrees with <em>me!</em>”</font></font>
<font color=Indigo><font color=magenta>“You would certainly seem to have seen, these
<font color=Olive>twenty-four hours</font>, a good deal more of it than for
some time before.</font> I hope,”</font> I went on bravely, <font color=Indigo>“that you’ve been enjoying
yourself.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=7><sup>¶7</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Oh, yes, I’ve been ever
so far; all round about—<font color=mistyrose>miles and miles
away.</font> I’ve never been so free.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=8><sup>¶8</sup>He had really a manner of his own, and I could only try to keep up with him.
<font color=Indigo>“Well, do you like
it?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=9><sup>¶9</sup>
<font color=magenta>He stood there smiling;</font> then at last he put
into two words— <font color=Goldenrod>“Do <em>you?</em>”</font> — <font color=sienna>more
discrimination than I had ever heard two words contain.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=10><sup>¶10</sup>Before I had time to deal with that, however, he continued as if with the
sense that this was <font color=teal>an impertinence to be
softened.</font>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Nothing could be more
charming than the way you take it, for of course if we’re alone together
now it’s you that are alone most. But I hope,”</font> he threw in,
<font color=Goldenrod>“you don’t
particularly mind!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=11><sup>¶11</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Having to do with
you?”</font> I asked. <font color=Indigo>“My dear child, how can I help <font color=mistyrose>minding?</font>
Though I’ve renounced all claim to your company—you’re so beyond me—I at
least greatly enjoy it. What else should I stay on for?”</font>
<font color=magenta>He looked at me more directly, and the expression
of his face, graver now,</font>
<font color=teal>struck me</font> as the most beautiful I had ever
found in it. <font color=Goldenrod><font color=mistyrose>“You stay on just for <em>that?</em>”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=12><sup>¶12</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Certainly. I <font color=mistyrose>stay on</font> as your friend and from the
tremendous interest I take in you till something can be done for you
that may be more worth your while. That needn’t surprise you.”</font>
<font color=teal><font color=sienna>My voice trembled so
that I felt it impossible to suppress the shake.</font></font> seg>
<font color=Indigo>“Don’t you remember
how I told you, when I came and sat on your bed the night of the storm,
that there was nothing in the world I wouldn’t do for you?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=13><sup>¶13</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Yes, yes!”</font> He, on
his side, <font color=magenta>more and more visibly nervous,</font>
<font color=sienna>had a tone to master;</font> but he was so much
more successful than I that, <font color=sienna>laughing out through
his gravity,</font> he could pretend we were pleasantly jesting. <font color=Goldenrod>“Only that, I think, was to
get me to do something for <em>you!</em>”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=14><sup>¶14</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“It was partly <font color=mistyrose>to get you to do something,”</font></font> I conceded. <font color=Indigo>“But,
you know, you didn’t <font color=mistyrose>do it.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=15><sup>¶15</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Oh, yes,”</font>
<font color=magenta>he said with the brightest superficial
eagerness,</font>
<font color=Goldenrod>“you wanted me to tell you
something.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=16><sup>¶16</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“That’s it. <font color=mistyrose>Out, straight out.</font> What you have on your
mind, you know.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=17><sup>¶17</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Ah, then, is <em>that</em> what <font color=mistyrose>you’ve stayed
over for?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=18><sup>¶18</sup>
<font color=sienna>He spoke with a gaiety through which <font color=teal>I could still catch the finest little quiver
of resentful passion;</font></font> but I can’t begin to express the effect upon me of an implication of
surrender even so faint. It was as if what I had yearned for had come at
last only to astonish me. <font color=Indigo>“Well, yes—I may as well make a clean breast of it, it was precisely
for that.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=19><sup>¶19</sup>
<font color=lightpink>He waited so long that I supposed it for the purpose of
repudiating the assumption on which my action had been founded;</font>
but what he finally said was: <font color=Goldenrod>“Do you mean now—here?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=20><sup>¶20</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“There couldn’t be a
better place or time.”</font>
<font color=magenta>He looked round him uneasily, and I had the
rare—oh, the queer!—impression of the very first symptom I had seen in
him of the approach of immediate fear.</font> It was as if he were
suddenly afraid of me—<font color=teal>which struck me</font>
indeed as perhaps the best thing to make him. Yet in the very pang of the
effort I felt it vain to try sternness, <font color=sienna>and I
heard myself the next instant so gentle as to be almost grotesque.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“You want so to go out
again?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=21><sup>¶21</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Awfully!”</font>
<font color=magenta>He smiled at me heroically,</font> and the
touching little bravery of it <font color=magenta>was enhanced by his
actually flushing with pain.</font> He had picked up his hat, which he
had brought in, and stood twirling it in a way that gave me, even as I was
just nearly reaching port, a perverse horror of what I was doing. To do it
in <em>any</em> way was an act of violence, for what did
it consist of but the obtrusion of the idea of grossness and guilt on a
small helpless creature who had been for me a revelation of the
possibilities of beautiful <font color=darkmagenta>intercourse?</font> Wasn’t it base to create for a being so exquisite a
mere alien awkwardness? I suppose I <font color=lime>now read into our
situation</font>
<font color=magenta>a clearness it couldn’t have had at the time,</font> for <font color=magenta>I seem to see our poor eyes</font>
<font color=maroon><font color=magenta>already lighted with
some spark of a prevision of the anguish that was to
come.</font></font> So we circled about, with terrors and scruples, like
fighters not daring to close. But it was for each other we feared! <font color=lightpink>That kept us a little longer suspended</font> and unbruised.
<font color=Goldenrod>“I’ll tell you
everything,”</font>Miles said— <font color=Goldenrod>“I mean <font color=mistyrose>I’ll tell you</font>
anything you like. You’ll stay on with me, and we shall both be all
right, <font color=mistyrose>and I <em>will</em> tell
you—I <em>will</em>.</font> But not now.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=22><sup>¶22</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Why <font color=mistyrose>not now?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=23><sup>¶23</sup>My insistence turned him from me <font color=sienna>and kept him once
more at his window in a silence during which, between us, you might have
heard a pin drop.</font> Then he was before me again with the air of a
person for whom, outside, someone who had frankly to be reckoned with was
waiting. <font color=Goldenrod><font color=magenta>“I have to see Luke.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=24><sup>¶24</sup>I had not yet reduced him to quite so vulgar a lie, and I felt
proportionately ashamed. But, horrible as it was, his lies made up my truth.
<font color=teal>I achieved thoughtfully a few loops of my
knitting.</font>seg> <font color=Indigo>“Well, then, go to Luke, <font color=lightpink>and I’ll wait for what you
promise.</font> Only, in return for that, satisfy, before you leave
me, one very much smaller request.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=25><sup>¶25</sup>
<font color=magenta>He looked as if he felt he had succeeded enough to be able
still a little to bargain.</font>
<font color=Goldenrod><font color=mistyrose>“Very much smaller—?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=26><sup>¶26</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Yes, a mere fraction of
the whole. Tell me”</font>—oh, my work preoccupied me, and I was
offhand!— <font color=Indigo>“if,
<font color=GreenYellow>yesterday</font>
<font color=Olive>afternoon</font>, from the table in the hall, <font color=bisque>you took, you know, my letter.”</font></font></div></div><div class=chapter n=24><h3>Chapter: 24</h3><div class=paragraph n=1><sup>¶1</sup>My sense of how he received this suffered for <font color=Olive>a minute</font> from
something that I can describe only <font color=teal>as a fierce
split of my attention—a stroke that at first, as I sprang straight up,
reduced me to the mere blind movement of getting hold of him, drawing
him close,</font> and, while I just fell for support against the nearest
piece of furniture, instinctively keeping him with his back to the window.
The appearance was full upon us that I had already had to deal with here:
<font color=magenta>Peter
Quint had come into view like a sentinel before a prison.
The next thing I saw was that, from outside, he had reached the window,
and then I knew that, close to the glass and glaring in through it, he
offered once more to the room his white
face of damnation.</font>
<font color=magenta>It represents but grossly what took place within
me at the sight to say</font> that on the second my decision was made;
yet I believe that no woman so overwhelmed ever in so short a time recovered
her grasp of the <em>act</em>. It came to me in the very
horror of the immediate presence that the act would be, <font color=magenta><font color=mistyrose>seeing and facing what I saw and faced,</font></font> to keep the boy himself unaware. The inspiration—I can call it by no
other name—was that I felt how voluntarily, how transcendently, I <em>might</em>. <font color=teal>It was like
fighting with a demon for a human soul,</font> and when I had fairly so
appraised it <font color=magenta>I saw how the human
soul</font>seg>— <font color=teal>held out,</font>
<font color=teal>in the tremor of my hands, at arm’s
length</font>—had a perfect dew of sweat on a lovely childish forehead. <font color=magenta>The face that was close to mine was as white as the face against the glass,</font>
<font color=sienna>and out of it presently came a sound, not low nor
weak,</font> but as if from much further away, <font color=Peru><font color=darkgreen>that I drank</font> like a waft of fragrance.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=2><sup>¶2</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Yes—I took
it.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>At this, <font color=sienna>with a moan of joy,</font>
<font color=teal>I enfolded, I drew him close; and while I held him
to my breast, where I could feel in the sudden fever of his little body
the tremendous pulse of his little heart,</font>
<font color=magenta>I kept my eyes on the thing at the window and saw
it move and shift its posture.</font> I have likened it to a sentinel,
but its slow wheel, for a moment, was rather the prowl of a baffled beast.
My present quickened courage, however, was such that, not too much to let it
through, <font color=maroon>I had to shade, as it were, my flame.</font>
<font color=magenta>Meanwhile the glare of the face was again at the
window, the scoundrel fixed as if to watch and wait.</font> It was the
very confidence that I might now defy him, as well as the positive
certitude, by this time, of the child’s unconsciousness, that made me go on.
<font color=Indigo>“What did you take it
for?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=3><sup>¶3</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“To see what you said
about me.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=4><sup>¶4</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“You opened the
letter?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=5><sup>¶5</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod><font color=mistyrose>“I opened it.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=6><sup>¶6</sup>
<font color=magenta>My eyes were now, <font color=teal>as
I held him off a little again,</font> on Miles’s own face, in which the collapse of mockery
showed me how complete was the ravage of uneasiness.</font> What was
prodigious was that at last, by my success, <font color=mediumseagreen>his
sense was sealed and his communication stopped:</font> he <font color=mistyrose>knew that he was in presence, but knew not of what, and
knew</font> still less that I also was and that I did know. And what did
this strain of trouble matter when <font color=magenta>my eyes went
back to the window only to see that the air was clear again</font>
and—by my personal triumph—the influence quenched? There was nothing there.
I felt that the cause was mine and that I should surely get <em>all</em>. <font color=Indigo>“And you found nothing!”</font>—I let my elation out.
<font color=magenta>He gave the most mournful, thoughtful little
headshake.</font>
<font color=Goldenrod><font color=mistyrose>“Nothing.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=7><sup>¶7</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Nothing, nothing!”</font></font> I almost shouted in my joy.</div><div class=paragraph n=8><sup>¶8</sup>
<font color=mistyrose><font color=Goldenrod>“Nothing,
nothing,"</font> he sadly repeated.</font></div><div class=paragraph n=9><sup>¶9</sup>
<font color=teal>I kissed his forehead</font>; it was drenched.
<font color=Indigo>“So what have you done
with it?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=10><sup>¶10</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod><font color=maroon>“I’ve burned it.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=11><sup>¶11</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Burned it?”</font></font> It was now or never. <font color=Indigo>“Is that what you did at school?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=12><sup>¶12</sup>Oh, what this brought up! <font color=Goldenrod><font color=mistyrose>“At school?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=13><sup>¶13</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=bisque>“Did you take letters?—or other things?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=14><sup>¶14</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod><font color=mistyrose>“Other things?”</font></font>
<font color=magenta>He appeared now</font> to be thinking of something
far off and <font color=teal>that reached him only through the
pressure of his anxiety.</font>
<font color=mistyrose>Yet it did reach him.</font>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Did I <em>steal?</em>”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=15><sup>¶15</sup>
<font color=magenta>I felt myself <font color=red>redden to the
roots of my hair</font> as well as wonder if it were more strange to
put to a gentleman such a question or to see him take it with allowances
that gave the very distance of his fall in the world.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“Was it for that you
mightn’t go back?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=16><sup>¶16</sup>The only thing he felt was rather a dreary little surprise. <font color=Goldenrod>“Did you know I mightn’t go
back?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=17><sup>¶17</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“I know</font> everything.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=18><sup>¶18</sup>
<font color=magenta>He gave me at this the longest and strangest
look.</font>
<font color=Goldenrod><font color=mistyrose>“Everything?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=19><sup>¶19</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Everything.</font> Therefore <em>did</em> you—?”</font> But I couldn’t say it again.</div><div class=paragraph n=20><sup>¶20</sup>Miles could, very simply. <font color=Goldenrod>“No. I didn’t steal.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=21><sup>¶21</sup>
<font color=magenta>"My face must have shown him I believed him
utterly;</font>
<font color=teal>yet my hands—but it was for pure tenderness—shook
him as if to ask him why, if it was all for nothing, he had condemned me
to months of torment.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“What then did you
do?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=22><sup>¶22</sup>
<font color=magenta>He looked in vague pain all round the top of the
room</font>
<font color=sienna>and drew his breath, two or three times over, as
if with difficulty.</font> He might have been standing at the bottom of
the sea <font color=magenta>and raising his eyes</font> to some faint
<font color=lawngreen>green</font> twilight. <font color=Goldenrod>“Well—I said things.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=23><sup>¶23</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Only that?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=24><sup>¶24</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“They thought it was
enough!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=25><sup>¶25</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“To turn you out
for?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=26><sup>¶26</sup>Never, truly, had a person <font color=mistyrose>“turned out”</font>
<font color=magenta>shown so little to explain it</font> as this
little person! <font color=magenta>He appeared to weigh my question,
but in a manner quite detached and almost helpless.</font>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Well, I suppose I
oughtn’t.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=27><sup>¶27</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“But to whom did you say
them?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=28><sup>¶28</sup>He evidently tried to remember, but it dropped—he had lost it. <font color=Goldenrod>“I don’t know!”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=29><sup>¶29</sup>
<font color=magenta>He almost smiled at me in the desolation of his
surrender,</font> which was indeed practically, by this time, so complete
that I ought to have left it there. But I was infatuated—<font color=magenta>I was blind</font> with victory, though even then
the very effect that was to have brought him so much nearer was already that
of added separation. <font color=Indigo>“Was
it to everyone?”</font> I asked.</div><div class=paragraph n=30><sup>¶30</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“No; it was only
to—”</font>
<font color=magenta>But he gave a sick little headshake.</font>
<font color=Goldenrod>“I don’t remember their
names.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=31><sup>¶31</sup>
<font color=Indigo>“Were they then so
many?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=32><sup>¶32</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“No—only a few. Those I
liked.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=33><sup>¶33</sup>
<font color=mistyrose>Those he liked?</font>
<font color=magenta>I seemed to float not into clearness, but into
a darker obscure,</font> and within <font color=Olive>a minute</font> there had come
to me out of my very pity the appalling alarm of his being perhaps innocent.
It was for the instant confounding and bottomless, for if he <em>were</em> innocent, what then on earth was <em>I?</em> Paralyzed, while it lasted, by the mere brush
of the question, <font color=teal>I let him go a little,</font> so
that, <font color=sienna>with a deep-drawn sigh,</font> he turned
away from me again; <font color=magenta>which, as he faced toward the
clear window,</font> I suffered, feeling that I had nothing now there to
keep him from. <font color=Indigo>“And did
they <font color=mistyrose>repeat what you said?”</font></font> I went on after a moment. He was soon at some distance from me, <font color=sienna>still breathing hard and again with the air</font>,
though now without anger for it, of being confined against his will. Once
more, as he had done before, <font color=magenta>he looked up at the
dim day</font> as if, of what had hitherto sustained him, nothing was
left but an unspeakable anxiety. <font color=Goldenrod>“Oh, yes,”</font> he nevertheless replied— <font color=Goldenrod>“they must have <font color=mistyrose>repeated</font> them. <font color=mistyrose>To
those <em>they</em> liked,”</font></font> he added.</div><div class=paragraph n=34><sup>¶34</sup>There was, somehow, less of it than I had expected; but I turned it over.
<font color=Indigo>“And these things came
round—?”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=35><sup>¶35</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“To the masters? Oh,
yes!”</font> he answered very simply. <font color=Goldenrod>“But I didn’t know they’d tell.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=36><sup>¶36</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“The masters? They didn’t—they’ve never told.</font> That’s why I ask you.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=37><sup>¶37</sup>
<font color=magenta>He turned to me again his little beautiful
fevered face.</font>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Yes, it was too
bad.”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=38><sup>¶38</sup>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Too bad?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=39><sup>¶39</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“What I suppose I
sometimes said. <font color=whitesmoke>To write home.”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=40><sup>¶40</sup>I can’t name the exquisite pathos of the contradiction given to such a speech
by such a speaker; I only know that the next instant <font color=sienna><font color=teal>I heard myself throw off with homely force:</font></font>
<font color=Indigo>“Stuff and
nonsense!”</font> But the next after that <font color=sienna>I
must have sounded stern enough.</font>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“What <em>were</em> these
things?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=41><sup>¶41</sup>My sternness was all for his judge, his executioner; yet it made him avert
himself again, and that movement made <em>me</em>, <font color=teal>with a single bound and <font color=sienna>an irrepressible cry,</font> spring straight upon him.</font> For
there again, against the glass, as if to blight his confession and stay his
answer, was the hideous author of our woe—the white face of damnation. I felt a sick swim at the drop of my
victory and all the return of my battle, so that the wildness of my
veritable leap only served as a great betrayal. <font color=magenta>I
saw him, from the midst of my act, meet it with a divination, and on the
perception that even now he only guessed, and that the window was still
to his own eyes free,</font> I let the impulse <font color=maroon>flame
up</font> to convert the climax of his dismay into the very proof of his
liberation. <font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“No more, no more, no more!”</font></font>
<font color=sienna>I shrieked,</font>
<font color=teal>as I tried to press him against me,</font> to my
visitant.</div><div class=paragraph n=42><sup>¶42</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Is she <em>here?</em>”</font>
<font color=sienna>Miles
panted</font> as he <font color=teal>caught with his <font color=magenta>sealed eyes</font> the direction of my words.</font> Then as his strange “she”<font color=teal>staggered me</font> and, <font color=sienna>with a gasp,</font>
<font color=mistyrose>I echoed it,</font>
<font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“Miss
Jessel, Miss
Jessel!”</font></font> he with a sudden fury gave me back.</div><div class=paragraph n=43><sup>¶43</sup>
<font color=teal>I seized,</font> stupefied, his supposition—some
sequel to what we had done to Flora, but
this made me only want to <font color=magenta>show him that it was
better still than that.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“It’s not <font color=mistyrose>Miss
Jessel!</font> But it’s at the window—straight before us.
It’s <em>there</em>—the coward horror, <font color=mistyrose>there</font> for the last time!”</font> At this,
after a second in which his head made the movement of a baffled dog’s on a
scent and then <font color=magenta><font color=teal>gave a
frantic little shake for air and light,</font></font> he was at me in
a <font color=darksalmon>white</font> rage, bewildered, <font color=magenta>glaring vainly over the place and missing wholly,</font> though it now,
to my sense, filled the room <font color=darkgreen>like the taste of
poison,</font> the wide, overwhelming presence.</div><div class=paragraph n=44><sup>¶44</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“It’s <em>he?</em>”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=45><sup>¶45</sup>I was so determined to have all my proof that <font color=magenta>I
flashed into ice to challenge him.</font>
<font color=Indigo>“Whom do you mean by <font color=mistyrose>‘he’?”</font></font></div><div class=paragraph n=46><sup>¶46</sup>
<font color=Goldenrod>“Peter Quint—you devil!”</font>
<font color=magenta>His face gave again, round the room, its
convulsed supplication.</font>
<font color=Goldenrod>“<em>Where?</em>”</font></div><div class=paragraph n=47><sup>¶47</sup>
<font color=sienna>They are in my ears still,</font> his supreme
surrender of the name and his tribute to my devotion. <font color=Indigo>“What does he matter now, my own?— <font color=mistyrose>what will he <em>ever</em>
matter? </font><em>I</em> have you,”</font> I launched at the
beast, <font color=Indigo>“but he has lost
you forever!”</font> Then, for the demonstration of my work, <font color=Indigo><font color=mistyrose>“There, <em>there!</em>”</font></font> I said to Miles.</div><div class=paragraph n=48><sup>¶48</sup>But he had already jerked straight round, <font color=magenta>stared,
glared again, and seen but <font color=sienna>the quiet
day.</font></font> With the stroke of the loss I was so proud of <font color=sienna>he uttered the cry of a creature hurled over an
abyss,</font> and <font color=teal>the grasp</font> with which I
recovered him might have been that of <font color=teal>catching him
in his fall.</font>
<font color=teal>I caught him, yes, I held him</font>—it may be
imagined with what a passion; but at the end of <font color=Olive>a minute</font> I
began to feel <font color=teal>what it truly was that I held.</font>
We were alone with <font color=sienna><font color=mistyrose>the quiet
day,</font></font> and his little heart, dispossessed, had
stopped.</div></div></body></html></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor"
