<p>Recently, the Canvas LMS put through a change that no doubt will affect many of us.  I received the following from my current institution&rsquo;s &ldquo;Canvas Liason&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Faculty,</p>
<p>On August 14th, Canvas did an update to the new design for Discussions.  In &gt;the old design, you had the option for a threaded discussion.  In the new &gt;design, it was not there.  When Canvas did the update, they set the ‘Disallow &gt;threaded replies’ to on (checked).  Not all discussions changed as it depended &gt;if you had the threaded discussion checked on the old design or not.  If you &gt;were using the new design discussions, it is set to checked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then we were given the <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/The-Product-Blog/Disallow-Threaded-Replies-option-in-Discussions/ba-p/612073">Canvas Community Link</a> for this change.</p>
<p>The thought of manually unchecking the box to allow threaded discussions filled me with dread&mdash;so I wrote some code to check how many of my courses were affected by this.</p>

<p>I was having a conversation with my most favorite student that I&rsquo;ve ever had in my entire career as a teacher a while back and we got to chatting about my little pattern of sending her songs I like from the &ldquo;Discover Weekly&rdquo; and &ldquo;Release Radar&rdquo; playlists that come my way via Spotify. She and I seem to have very few similarities when it comes to music. She likes to say that I have somewhat &ldquo;girlish&rdquo; music tastes (not meant as a pejorative, far from it, at least, I think! that said, I seem to love everything <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1dUrqVHcv2FCXxlIqzIbiG?si=bQ4GRS40Tuq7x_kkbZ7oew">NERIAH</a> releases), but I like to think that I like certain songs based on how easy it is for me to move my body in tune with them. I figure I would do a little testing to see if my intuitions were correct or not. So, in order to do just that, off we go.</p>
<h3 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h3>
<p>The first step was to hop over to the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com">Spotify site for developers</a>. You can follow some of the really nice tutorials on accessing the API (see <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started">here</a>) &hellip; thus, with an application sent up, we should be good to go with accessing the API via Python. On that note, we will want to install the &ldquo;spotipy&rdquo; library (available (here)[https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1/]). With that installed, we can start writing some code ourselves. We need a way to traverse the entirety of the &ldquo;Liked Songs&rdquo; playlist. As per usual, let&rsquo;s write some code, which is simple enough (spotipy makes it really easy and simple, I should say). So let&rsquo;s say we just want to create a .json file with all of our &ldquo;Liked Songs&rdquo;? Easy enough:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So, this will give us a .json file that has all of our &ldquo;Liked Songs&rdquo; in it.</p>
<p>Now that we have that code written, we can dig a little deeper into how we want/are going to use the spotipy library. Spotify has all kinds of definitions, ideas, data, explanations for their key numbers that describe a song&rsquo;s &ldquo;audio features.&rdquo; Spotify&rsquo;s numbers and definitions are available <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features">here</a>. I am interested in figuring out how well my own musical sensitivity either converges or strongly diverges with those of other Spotify listeners. Here is some code to grab every single song from your &ldquo;Liked Songs&rdquo; playlist while also pulling down each song&rsquo;s &ldquo;audio features&rdquo;:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Thus we now have a .json file that stores all our &ldquo;Liked Songs&rdquo; and another separate file that has all of the songs&rsquo; &ldquo;features.&rdquo; So, what are the odds that when I use the phrase—as I did above—that I like songs that are easy to &ldquo;move my body&rdquo; to, that something is captured by an &ldquo;audio feature&rdquo; like &ldquo;danceability&rdquo;?</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_34/spotify_docs_for_danceability.png" alt="danceability_explanation_from_spotify_api"></p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s no doubt this &ldquo;definition&rdquo; possesses quite a bit of ambiguity, to say the very least. One doesn&rsquo;t need to be a big reader of Nietzsche to know that &ldquo;to dance&rdquo; is a shockingly vague pair of words to use: what kind of dance, how fast, how slow, etc. What on earth does it mean &ldquo;to dance&rdquo;? Well, I was kind of hoping that a bit of data analysis here might give me the opportunity to think about dance and dancing (and not simply because I have been working a lot as of late on dance and dancing as a figure of/for thinking in Nietzsche [this too is part of another project that &ldquo;my most favorite student forever&rdquo; I mentioned earlier and I are working on with regards to an early F. Scott Fitzgerald story]). So, does my &ldquo;Liked Songs&rdquo; list have a lot of songs that show a high degree of &ldquo;danceability,&rdquo; at least as far as Spotify is concerned? Well, let&rsquo;s make some graphs and see:</p>
<h3 id="lets-do-some-analysis">Let&rsquo;s Do Some Analysis!</h3>
<p>So—I&rsquo;ll link <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/spotify_analysis/blob/main/spotify_data_analysis.ipynb">here</a> to the Jupyter notebook with all the code used to generate these visualizations (and the entire repo is available <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/spotify_analysis">here</a>)—if we look at a histogram of the &ldquo;danceability&rdquo; numbers in my &ldquo;Liked Songs&rdquo; playlist, we get something that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_34/danceability_distribution.png" alt="danceability_histogram_plot"></p>
<p>Hmmmmmm &hellip; okay, so I think this strikes me as a tad bit surprising (intriguing at the very least). I like to think that I literally only add songs to my &ldquo;Liked Songs&rdquo; if they&rsquo;re easy to &ldquo;move my body to&rdquo; (although, to be sure, I have no doubt that&rsquo;s an exaggeration). If we have a look at my mean danceability scores we can plot that as well:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_34/danceability_with_mean.png" alt="danceability_with_mean_indicated"></p>
<p>I would love to know how this histogram compares to other Spotify listeners. What&rsquo;s the mean danceability score for the &ldquo;Liked Songs&rdquo; in users&rsquo; playlists? Is my distribution slightly above the mean, slightly below, &hellip;? Is my sense of &ldquo;danceability&rdquo; at all in line with other users&rsquo; conceptions of such a thing?</p>
<p>What about the &ldquo;energy&rdquo; feature, too? Might that be a better bet &hellip;?</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_34/spotify_docs_for_energy.png" alt="spotify_docs_for_energy"></p>
<p>Probably not, given the examples here: I don&rsquo;t dig &ldquo;death metal&rdquo; at all.</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_34/energy_hist_with_mean.png" alt="energy_hist_with_mean_line"></p>
<p>We can also easily plot these two features together and see what there is to see there:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_34/danceability_vs_energy_plotly.png" alt="danceability_vs_energy"></p>
<p>Or, if we wanted the <a href="https://plotly.com/python/">plotly</a> image with all the &ldquo;hover_data&rdquo; available when one mouses over a point:</p>

       width="1100"
       height="600"
       >

</div>


<p>I also tried to create some plots that would include when the song was added to the playlist to see if there was anything that could be said about potential changes in taste over time:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_34/energy_vs_danceability_by_year.png" alt="energy_vs_danceability_by_year"></p>
<p>Ooooh, and what about &ldquo;energy&rdquo; and the song&rsquo;s &ldquo;tempo&rdquo; &hellip;?</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_34/energy_vs_tempo.png" alt="energy_vs_tempo"></p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s very little doubt that the numbers here for me are a bit of a mess, to say the very least:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_34/pairplot.png" alt="seaborn_pairplot"></p>
<p>And even if we make some plots with the most &ldquo;recently added&rdquo; songs to them, again, it would seem that things fall within a somewhat sizeable range, at least when it comes to these &ldquo;danceability&rdquo; and &ldquo;energy&rdquo; numbers:</p>

<p>Yeah, not quite sure what conclusions to draw here from all this just yet &hellip;</p>
<h4 id="appendix">Appendix</h4>
<p>So, earlier I mentioned wanting to have some other users to compare my numbers with—and during the composition of this post my second most favorite student ever (I know, I know, we joke quite a lot about this unfortunate moniker), William, offered to share his Spotify data with me (I&rsquo;ve mentioned William <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2023-04-15-fitzgerald-hemingway-continued/">before</a> in <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2023-04-07-fitzgerald-hemingway/">previous posts</a>). Now, in William&rsquo;s case, he actually knows quite a bit about music (a ton, actually), given that he is an avid guitarist and piano player. He loves to talk to me about music—when working through difficult philosophical ideas, ten times out of ten he reaches for a musical analogy with which to think through a concept &hellip; I play the game and pretend as well as I can that I understand, but, as he knows, I literally don&rsquo;t have a single musical bone in my body, sadly to say &hellip;  I know, too, that I think he and I are really quite different from one another in terms of our musical tastes. Do the numbers bear that out? Well, how about we return to our &ldquo;danceability vs. energy&rdquo; scatter plots and see how William and I compare. My guess is that these plots will show very little overlap, if any. Is that the case? Well, let&rsquo;s write some code and see:</p>


<div>

<p>Lol, so, pictures are nice, but maybe we can grab some numbers? As those in the data science field know, the &ldquo;Jaccard index&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Jaccard similarity&rdquo;) can give us a nice numerical representation of how &ldquo;similar&rdquo; William&rsquo;s numbers are to mine. <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/spotify_analysis/blob/main/comparative_analysis.py">Code</a> for this gives us a Jaccard similarity of, literally, 0.00.) This would appear to bear out my own intuitions here &hellip; :)</p>
<p>Oh, and since we&rsquo;re oh the &ldquo;comparison train&rdquo; here now, I wondered about my &ldquo;valence&rdquo; scores in comparison to his—again, my intuition was that I was just slightly more on the &ldquo;happy&rdquo; side than him? Do the numbers support that?</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_34/im_happier_than_will.png" alt="william_vs_me_wrt_valence"></p>
<p>Hehehehe, I guess so, but perhaps only &ldquo;barely so&rdquo; &hellip; :) Obviously, there&rsquo;s much more to be done here, especially now that I have William&rsquo;s data &hellip; as is so usual, &ldquo;more to come,&rdquo; to be sure.</p>

This past week (Week 6), we had a read of some somewhat contemporary work in this field, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>Crystal VanKooten&rsquo;s &ldquo;Methodologies and Methods for Research in Digital Rhetoric&rdquo; (available <a href="https://www.enculturation.net/methodologies-and-methods-for-research-in-digital-rhetoric">here</a>);</li>

<li>John Gallagher&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Framework for Internet Case Study Methodology in Writing Studies,&rdquo; also available in <em>Computers and Composition</em> 54 (2019): 1-14.</li>
</ol>
<p>I found the discussion of these texts on the boards to be incredibly thought-provoking (a big shout-out to <a href="https://www.dupage88.net/site/page/15113">Leslie Allenspach</a> and many others for getting us onto this track). One of the things that bubbled to the surface most was what it might mean to talk about users&rsquo; &ldquo;engagement&rdquo; on a social media platform like Twitter. The topic frequently centered around scholars&rsquo; use of said platform as a kind of &ldquo;object of research&rdquo; all on its own—and many participants were somewhat surprised (I think) to learn that scholars and academics have produced work &ldquo;mining&rdquo; data from this platform in the same way that those within the private sector (companies, ad agencies, etc.) have been doing for years and years now.</p>
<p>Of course, I got to thinking about all of this from my own somewhat peculiar position of being an academic who also knows how to code (thankfully—or &ldquo;hopefully&rdquo;—that number continues to grow and grow each and every day) &hellip; and, so, needless, to say, I was curious to think about what kinds of &ldquo;data points&rdquo; one might utilize in order to think through this admittedly somewhat amorphous concept of &ldquo;user engagement.&rdquo; Furthermore, I started to wonder a bit too about whether or not there were somewhat more &ldquo;expansive&rdquo; parsings of this term than the one that we might get if we solely looked at the simple binary mechanism of the &ldquo;Like&rdquo; button. Moreover, I got meditating whether or not it would behoove us who work solely within the humanities (or who engage with the study of rhetoric, but, perhaps, not necessarily with that adjective, &ldquo;digital,&rdquo; before the noun) to try to think about this issue of &ldquo;engagement&rdquo; in a more expansive way. What do I mean, exactly? Well, I wonder if &ldquo;engagement&rdquo;—at least when we&rsquo;re talking about the infamous &lsquo;Like&rsquo; button—is often, quite unfruitfully, thought solely in a binary way: either a post is liked or it&rsquo;s not. But do we not need a metric for engagement that allows for some kind of degree? It&rsquo;s hard to say &ldquo;how engaged&rdquo; one might be if the button options are largely binary &hellip; :) And how soon before we shift away from the like button simply because it might not (for many) be sophisticated enough to give us much data as a &lsquo;data point.&rsquo; No doubt Riddick is correct to say that this button can give us a &ldquo;data point&rdquo;—that&rsquo;s undoubtedly true, but I often wonder how useful the like button is &hellip; I have done some very simple machine learning on Twitter datasets in the past (see <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-03-26-twitter-viral-tweet-classification-project_08/">here</a> for an example of trying to classify a &ldquo;Viral Tweet&rdquo; and <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-02-15-twitter-sentiment-analysis_07/">here</a> for some sentiment analysis applied to Twitter data) and got thinking about how often a &ldquo;feature&rdquo; of this kind of dataset is utilized in order to train the models. Certainly the length gives us a non-binary structure and, no doubt, that&rsquo;s partly why we so often utilize it in the <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-feature-engineering-importance-tools-and-techniques-for-machine-learning-2080b0269f10">feature engineering</a> part of our workflows.</p>
<p>As I was responding to the posts over this past weekend, I was wondering how others have operationalized something like this &ldquo;engagement&rdquo; factor and then utilize it in models. I came across a dataset through the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>—which is a wonderful resource for those interested in training and testing out machine learning models—that had a ton of <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Buzz+in+social+media+#">labeled and wrangled data</a> that discussed <a href="http://grabmemedia.com/buzz-and-hype/">&ldquo;Buzz&rdquo;</a> on Twitter. I also came across another <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3184558.3191591">published paper</a> by Clemens Deusser, et. al.—after running the linear regression model I&rsquo;ll showcase below—that was after a similar quarry. Table 1 of Deusser, et. al. has a wonderful list of &ldquo;Features&rdquo; utilized, which included everything from the &ldquo;contentlength&rdquo; of the message string, to the number of comments, likes, replies, shares, reply ratios, and so much more. The dataset from Kawala, et. al. on the UCI site had a list of 77 different attributes collected in their dataset, with all kinds of things being measured (all descriptions below come from the datasets &ldquo;Twitter.names&rdquo; file, which contains all the information about the columns in the dataset). Here is just a small sample:</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Average Discussions Length (ADL) (columns [63,69]): This feature directly measures the average length of a discussion belonging to the instance&rsquo;s topic.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Author Interaction (AT) (columns [49,55]): This feature measures the average number of authors interacting on the instance&rsquo;s topic within a discussion.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Number of Created Discussions (NCD) (columns [0,6]): This feature measures the number of discussions created at time step t and involving the instance&rsquo;s topic.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Author Increase (AI) (columns [7,13]): This features [<em>sic</em>] the number of new authors interacting on the instance&rsquo;s topic at time t (i.e. its popularity)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Attention Level (measured with number of authors) (AS(NA)) (columns [14,20]): This feature is a measure of the attention payed [<em>sic</em>] to a [<em>sic</em>] the instance&rsquo;s topic on a social media.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Attention Level (measured with number of contributions) (AS(NAC)) (columns [35,41]): This feature is a measure of the attention payed [<em>sic</em>] to a the instance&rsquo;s topic on a social media.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>In the very rightmost column, there is a &ldquo;Predicted attribute,&rdquo; defined as follows: &ldquo;Mean Number of active discussion (NAD). This attribute is a positive integer that describe the popularity of the instance&rsquo;s topic,&rdquo; which is the degree of &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; for a particular topic.</p>
<p>Could we do a little bit of work to see which of these attributes might be most strongly related to this &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; number? Let&rsquo;s write a little code and see. Rather than transferring all the code over, I&rsquo;ll just embed a notebook:</p>

<p>We can see from the first regression plot—and from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination">R-squared score (R^2)</a> as well, to be sure—that there is a very a <a href="https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/data-literacy/stats/ex9-corr/index.html">strong positive correlation</a> between these two variables.</p>
<p>The second plot I put in there just to add a little bit of data on some of the other columns that were in the correlation matrix created earlier.</p>
<p>It would be quite interesting to see if one could simple work with just the number of likes to see if the results were similar. I&rsquo;ll probably save that for another day, lol! :)</p>

Wanting to just try it out I figured I would put a pretty simple snippet of code that is part of my ever-continuing enjoyment of working with our Canvas LMS solely through the API—trying never to open a web browser. :) With that in mind, how about some code to download all of the submissions for a particular assignment in a course? (It&rsquo;s getting close to mid-term time, so those&rsquo;ll be flooding in soon enough &hellip; ) I&rsquo;ve also been having tons of fun lately trying to write code from scratch to do things natively available in the LMS &hellip; this is perhaps another prime example of that.</p>
<p>First thing—with our course id and assignment id in hand—we can head over to the Submission endpoint of the API, grab all the submissions, and traverse the returned dictionary for the &ldquo;html_url&rdquo; key, which contains the link to the actual submitted file. The full schema as per the API &hellip;:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The task was to see if we could clean things up a little bit here—paring down some of the code (the original had 68 lines), remove extraneous print statements, etc. Just from glancing casually at the code, it might be clear why we would want to do such things. From the point of view of the <code>logging</code> library, there&rsquo;s much to do here that can be handled in far fewer lines of code. If we utilize all the affordances of the library, we can get something that is much more streamlined and efficient and perhaps much more helpful for users.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The cleaned-up version doesn&rsquo;t really get us fewer lines of code, but it does look much, much more readable and far easier to understand. And the error messages are successfully logged to the proper places, which is the whole point of this, to be sure! Output where we don&rsquo;t get any error messages looks like this now:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_33/output_of_reworked_script.png" alt="output_with_no_errors"></p>

It was only after posting it that I noticed that Justin Rice beat me to the punch with his post <a href="https://www.litcharts.com/blog/analitics/what-makes-hemingway/">&ldquo;What Makes Hemingway Hemingway?&rdquo;</a> over on <a href="https://www.litcharts.com/blog/">&ldquo;The LitCharts Blog&rdquo;</a>. What was terribly curious to me was that Rice showcases some of the key characteristics that one thinks &ldquo;makes Hemingway Hemingway&rdquo;—sentence length, word length, lexical richness, dialogue proportion, parts of speech, characteristic words, and much more. However, I found the plot concerning Hemingway&rsquo;s use of different &ldquo;parts of speech&rdquo; to be quite intriguing, as that plot only utilized some of the most basic parts of speech: adjectives, adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs.</p>
<p>Rice&rsquo;s post doesn&rsquo;t link to any code or repo (not a criticism, just something to note before I proffer some additional code/plots of my own here), but it would seem that the &ldquo;parts of speech,&rdquo; obviously, doesn&rsquo;t utilize all of the possibilities for POS tagging and parsing. Also, it seems to me that it might be interesting to see if we could produce some graphs that utilized some of the &ldquo;extended POS tags&rdquo; that are available through a library like <a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a>. If we utilize all of the POS tags on a Hemingway workj, what would we see—and what would we see when we compared it with something of Fitzgerald&rsquo;s? Well, I grabbed a copy of <em>The Great Gatsby</em> along with <em>The Sun Also Rises</em> and turned the spaCy on it. (The key Jupyter notebook for this grammatical analysis is available <a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/kspicer80/fitzgerald_hemingway/blob/main/part_of_speech_analysis.ipynb">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s show it. As usual, importing libraries and getting our text files read in (as per standard operating procedure, all code for this post is available in the following <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/fitzgerald_hemingway">repository</a>):</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.litcharts.com/blog/analitics/what-makes-hemingway/">Rice muses</a>: &ldquo;Is it true that Hemingway&rsquo;s sentences are especially short?&rdquo; and replies, &ldquo;Hemingway&rsquo;’&rsquo;s sentences clock in about 7 words shorter than average, so yes: his sentences are short. Proust&rsquo;s sentences, meanwhile, are really, really long. Surprisingly, the average sentence in <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> is shorter than the average sentence in Hemingway’s writing.&rdquo; This would seem to match our &ldquo;extended&rdquo; plot that showed Hemingway&rsquo;s use of way more punctuation marks than in <em>The Great Gatsby</em>.</p>
<p>I also thought we might dig into the direct object counts for Hemingway, following the intuition (again, in <a href="https://www.litcharts.com/blog/analitics/what-makes-hemingway/">Rice</a>) that &ldquo;Hemingway’s verbs (&lsquo;punched&rsquo;, &lsquo;stroked&rsquo;, &lsquo;galloped&rsquo;, and so on) are visceral and active.&rdquo; Here are some plots of those counts:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_31/direct_object_counts.png" alt="direct_object_counts"></p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_31/direct_objects_and_punctuation_counts.png" alt="direct_object_and_punctuation_counts"></p>
<p>William, the student I mentioned in <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2023-04-01-fitzgerald-hemingway/">my previous post</a> who got all the wheels turning <em>re</em> Hemingway, mentioned another little odd syntactic idiosyncrasy/tic of Hemingway that I would love to be able to pull out somehow. He said that he always noticed something that he called &ldquo;the Hemingway and&rdquo; where we would get sentences linked by an &ldquo;and&rdquo; where the phrases linked by the &ldquo;and&rdquo; are often hard to parse—often, he said, they will veer off on tangents that are hard to keep track of. Here is a nice example from &ldquo;Cat in the Rain&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I want to pull my hair back tight and smooth and make a big knot at the back that I can feel,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I want to have a kitty to sit on my lap and purr when I stroke her.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; George said from the bed.
&ldquo;And I want to eat at a table with my own silver and I want candles. And I want it to be spring and I want to brush my hair out in front of a mirror and I want a kitty and I want some new clothes.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, shut up and get something to read,&rdquo; George said. He was reading again.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That second-to-last sentence might be a good example illustrating William&rsquo;s intuition. The sentences are linked by &ldquo;and,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s not clear if there is some larger logic that is operating. Of course, in this case above, it seems simple enough to note the way in which the wife&rsquo;s desire is the thing that coheres all of the different sentences together. It would be intriguing to see if we could quantify this intuition somehow. Does Hemingway&rsquo;s work really have a plethora of sentences that look like this &hellip; and how might we program a script to find these kinds of things for us? Obviously, it wouldn&rsquo;t be enough to just find all the sentences that had the &ldquo;and&rdquo; conjunction in it—and we we would want to find some way to somehow tag the two &ldquo;domains&rdquo; present in the clauses separated by &ldquo;and&rdquo; such that we could try to measure some kind of distance or proximity between the different regions or regimes of the clauses.</p>
<p>Sounds like a nice project—I&rsquo;ll spend some think-time on this and see what I can come up with—more to come, as usual, to be sure.</p>

I spent quite a bit of time canvassing a great deal of the DH/computer programming learning I have acquired over the last couple of years. I gave a somewhat interesting test project version of some more stylometry/text classification work,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> focusing quite directly on some work another (former) student of mine, William Mastin, and I have been doing on one of his most favorite authors, Ernest Hemingway. It would be absolutely impossible to canvas the interminable discussions we had about &ldquo;Papa&rdquo; as of late, but I figured I could just share some of the computational work that was tangentially related to this endeavor.</p>
<p>I think the real impetus for much of this computational investigation was due to the fact that, in many of those conversations, William would often draw parallels and comparisons between Hemingway and Fitzgerald (we even read very closely one of my most favorite Fitzgerald stories, &ldquo;Babylon Revisited&rdquo;). I was curious—could one, say, train a machine learning model to tell the difference between a text written by Hemingway and one by Fitzgerald? For sure—and what I still find so fascinating about all of this is that the way in which the models can do this are not really all that &ldquo;complex&rdquo; or &ldquo;complicated&rdquo; or &ldquo;sophisticated&rdquo;—at least, they are definitely not more sophisticated than when a seasoned reader can (perhaps somewhat) intuitively tell the difference immediately between Hemingway&rsquo;s and Fitzgerald&rsquo;s stylistic tendencies. So let&rsquo;s write a little Python code and I&rsquo;ll try to take readers through what&rsquo;s going on along each step of the process.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The first step is data gathering, so we head over to <a href="https://gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg.org</a> to grab texts that are available and in the public domain by both <a href="https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/420">Fitzgerald</a> and <a href="https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/50533">Hemingway</a>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Once we have some texts that we can use to train and test the classifier models, we can start coding. We will be utilizing one of the go-to machine learning libraries within Python, <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">sci-kit learn</a>, an absolute staple for those working in machine learning. Thus we start with our import statements (we&rsquo;re also using <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">seaborn</a> and <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> again for plotting, pandas for data wrangling, etc. [the <code>load_data</code> function is just a simple function to read in all the text files and keep track of the author of each text]):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">from</span> helper_functions <span style="color:#f92672">import</span> load_data

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next we call our <code>load data</code> function to load in all of our text files and then convert that into a pandas DataFrame that contains the text of the work (in the <code>text_data</code> column) along with the named author in the <code>label</code> column. We also want to let sklearn know which columns have the &ldquo;text&rdquo; and which one contains the &ldquo;real/true&rdquo; labels for each text:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>text_data, labels <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> load_data(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;data&#39;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>df <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> pd<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>DataFrame(list(zip(text_data, labels)), columns<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;text_data&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;label&#39;</span>])
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>X <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> df[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;text_data&#39;</span>]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>y <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> df[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;label&#39;</span>]
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then we utilize one of the functions from the sklearn library that takes the dataset and splits it into &ldquo;training&rdquo; and &ldquo;testing&rdquo; sets. The training set will be the data that the model is given to &ldquo;learn&rdquo; what makes a Hemingway text a Hemingway text (and similarly for Fitzgerald); the &ldquo;testing&rdquo; data is just that: those are the texts that the model has never seen before and thus will make predictions on/about. The normal split in machine learning is usually 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing, but here we&rsquo;re passing a percentage of 30%:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> train_test_split(
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>													X,

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>													test_size<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0.3</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>													random_state<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">42</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now that the training and testing sets are split up, we can start to transform all of this text data into what the model can understand, namely, numbers:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Create a bag-of-words representation of the text data</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>X_train_vec <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> vectorizer<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>fit_transform(X_train)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>X_test_vec <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> vectorizer<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>transform(X_test)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As seasoned DH folks knows, what the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer"><code>CountVectorizer()</code></a> function does is it takes all of the words in the text and converts the whole text file into just a long list of words. (This is often called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model">&ldquo;bag of words&rdquo; representation</a> because all the program is doing is, quite literally, counting each word and how many times each word appears; everything ends up in a &ldquo;bag&rdquo; because this process disregards grammar and also word order too.) The second and third lines of code just apply this technique/function to both the training and testing sets—for more information, the <code>.fit</code> method is explained in the documentation <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.fit">here</a> and the <code>.fit_transform</code> <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.fit_transform">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once the text files are converted into a matrix (i.e. the data has been <a href="https://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning-multinomial-naive-bayes-vectorization/">&ldquo;vectorized&rdquo;</a>), one can then train a model to make predictions on the testing data. For this little project, we&rsquo;ll utilize a widely used algorithm that is based on &ldquo;Bayes&rsquo; theorem,&rdquo; which &ldquo;describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> This is a very commonly used model for &ldquo;text classification&rdquo; problems and it thus serves our purposes here well enough.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Once the model is instantiated, we can fit it on our data as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>nb <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> MultinomialNB()
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>nb<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>fit(X_train_vec, y_train)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So how accurate is the model on the texts that were set aside for the testing purposes? One of the standard ways to see the accuracy of the model is to use a number of metrics—i.e. &ldquo;precision,&rdquo; &ldquo;recall,&rdquo; &ldquo;f1-score,&rdquo; etc.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Sklearn has a built-in function for this, <code>classification_report</code> which quickly provides us with these metrics and scores. Below we&rsquo;ll print out the <code>accuracy_score</code> for the testing data along with the other metrics:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Evaluate the model on the testing set</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>accuracy <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> nb<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>score(X_test_vec, y_test)

</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_30/classification_report_for_f_v_h_problem.png" alt="classification_report_for_f_v_h"></p>
<p>These are fantastic scores for the model. Of course, there are also nice and simple ways to visualize the predictions the model has made by utilizing what is called a &ldquo;confusion matrix&rdquo;. This is a simple picture that shows us the number of &ldquo;true positives,&rdquo; &ldquo;true negatives,&rdquo; &ldquo;false positives,&rdquo; and &ldquo;false negatives.&rdquo; The code to produce the plot is, again, rather simple enough to implement:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># Predict the class labels for the test set</span>

<p>A classifier with scores like these is considered to be performing extremely well. But what if we wanted to kick the tires on this model just a little bit more by passing it, say, a text by Hemingway that the model has never before encountered, either in training or testing (many machine learning modeling workflows include this as the &ldquo;validation&rdquo; set, a sample to make a prediction on that was not in the training or testing datasets)? Well, let&rsquo;s feed this brand-new (to the model) text and see who it predicts wrote it. We&rsquo;ll ask it to make a prediction about Hemingway&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Snows of Kilimanjaro.&rdquo; Again, easy enough—and the steps are the same (we read in the text file, vectorize it, and then pass it to the model to make a prediction):</p>

<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_30/prediction_for_h_snows.png" alt="nb_model_prediction_for_snows"></p>
<p>Nice—a perfectly correct prediction. I should say that one could easily wonder just a bit if the binary parameter here in this problem—a text is either by Hemingway or it&rsquo;s not—does come with some starting assumptions that one could tweak slightly if they wanted. What if the comparison was not between Hemingway and Fitzgerald but between Hemingway and someone a reader might consider to already be somewhat &ldquo;closer&rdquo; to Hemingway in terms of style? What about texts by John Steinbeck? Again, we can reuse the code already and simply alter it so that we have the program read in the texts by Steinbeck in the training part of the process. Once again, a very simple Naive Bayes classifier can quite easily distinguish between Hemingway and Steinbeck too:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_30/classification_report_for_h_v_s_problem.png" alt="accuracy_scores_for_nb_models_f_v_h"></p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_30/cm_for_h_v_steinbeck.png" alt="confusion_matrix_for_f_h_and_s"></p>
<p>And, once more, if we pass it a text by Steinbeck (<em>In Dubious Battle</em>) for validation, we can ask for another prediction—and we get:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_30/prediction_for_s_in_dubious_battle.png" alt="in_dubious_battle_prediction"></p>
<p>What I find so curious about this entire process is what I mentioned earlier, the model can seem to figure out who authored what simply by counting words and keeping track of their frequencies—nothing more sophisticated would seem to be required here. There are, of course, far more intricate algorithms and vectorizers that can be used when working with textual data (the &ldquo;term-frequency inverse document frequency,&rdquo; TF-IDF for short, is just one example), but such sophistication seems unnecessary—at least here in this particular case. The frequency counts of words seem to be enough to distinguish between the writing of these authors. It might perhaps go without saying, but I think these developments ask those of us working within the humanities to potentially rethink how we want to talk about something like a writer&rsquo;s &ldquo;style.&rdquo; Those working in literature might love to use all kinds of literary techniques, rhetorical tropes, and much more to discuss a writer&rsquo;s style. The machine would seem to be able to get along just fine by merely(?) counting things. As I say, I think this is incredibly thought-provoking for humanistic study more broadly—and I continue to be amazed with the results.</p>

<p> Of course, one could utilize all the rich information that would come from looking at the author&rsquo;s grammatical tics and preferences. A simple workflow for this would take the texts and extract all of the &ldquo;parts of speech&rdquo; (POS) for each word in each sentence (the <a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy library</a> is a fantastically awesome workhouse for this kind of thing); once one had &ldquo;POS tagged&rdquo; each sentence, those counts—of nouns, verbs, participles, direct objects (something of a big favorite of Hemingway, in particular), even the number of punctuation marks—could be used in further <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering">&ldquo;feature engineering&rdquo;</a> the model so that it could use those numbers to make predictions.

I have had a couple of times when running the script shown in that post where something goes slightly awry: perhaps I have mistyped one of the student or assignment ids and the script runs into an error while iterating through the dataframe that contains all of the data I want to upload. There&rsquo;s no error handling in that script, so if I go and correct the mistake in the data file and then rerun the script, it now ends up reposting all of the data in the rows that it runs through before running into the line of code containing the snag. I opened up an <a href="https://github.com/ucfopen/canvasapi/issues/581">&ldquo;issue&rdquo;</a> on ucfopen&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/ucfopen/canvasapi">github</a>, asking where I would go via the canvasapi library to determine if a particular submission has any comments already uploaded to it—this would be one way to handle the potential duplication of comments. I got a really nice response from IonMich (Ioannis Michaloliakos) for how to handle this. For some reason that I&rsquo;m not quite sure I can account for, this response pushed me to wonder if I couldn&rsquo;t myself figure out how to just interact with the Canvas Live API itself, rather than going through the python wrapper provided via canvasapi. (I have used the <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><code>requests</code> library</a> in python for other projects before, but I got to thinking if things might be easier to just utilize that library alone.) This launched me off to the <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/index.html">official documentation</a> for Instructure&rsquo;s API.</p>
<p>Following the path laid out by IonMich&rsquo;s response, I wandered over to the <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/submissions.html#method.submissions_api.bulk_update"><code>Submissions</code> endpoint</a>, zeroing in on the <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/submissions.html#method.submissions_api.bulk_update">method</a> that will allow one to &ldquo;Grade or comment on multiple submissions.&rdquo; Having found the method that would seem to do what I want to do, the next step was getting the data I wanted to upload in the correct form and structure. As detailed in the earlier, previously mentioned, post, I am still keeping the data to be uploaded to Canvas in a <code>.json</code> file that has been slightly altered:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_28/test_json_datafile.png" alt="testing_json_file"></p>
<p>Typical workflow will follow: library import, getting all the information we need to successfully query the API, etc.:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> json

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>API_KEY <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> XXXXX <span style="color:#75715e"># Here&#39;s where you insert your own unique API key </span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So what we need to do first is to get our data from the <code>.json</code> file into a format that we can then appropriately pass to the &ldquo;Request Parameters&rdquo; of the API (<a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/submissions.html#method.submissions_api.bulk_update">here</a> again is the documentation about what these parameters should look like).</p>
<p>Given that I have data that looks like the screenshot above, we need to do a little tiny bit of reworking here—although certainly not much, all things considered.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">with</span> open(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;responses_json_for_blog_post.json&#39;</span>) <span style="color:#66d9ef">as</span> f:

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As seasoned veterans know, the <code>json.load</code> returns us a Python <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/json-load-in-python/">dictionary</a>—in our case it gives us a dictionary with a single key, <code>&quot;grade_data&quot;</code>. The value for that key is itself a list of dictionaries:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_28/type_from_json_load_and_full_dict_image.png" alt="json_object_type_and_full_dict"></p>
<p>Now we just need to write a (very!) simple <code>for loop</code> that will let us extract out the necessary data to feed as parameters to the <code>POST</code> call:</p>

<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_28/dict_for_upload.png" alt="dict_for_upload_image"></p>
<p>Of course, we&rsquo;re shooting for something that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_28/canvas_api_docs_screenshot.png" alt="instructure_official_docs_screenshot"></p>
<p>Looks good! Now all we need to do is get everything set up properly for the <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/#passing-parameters-in-urls">requests library</a>.</p>
<p>As with so much here in this whole &ldquo;computer science&rdquo; realm, one can often get exactly what they want in a single line of code:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Simple as that.</p>
<p>Of course, the big question here is which avenue to prefer taking here: going through the ucf canvasapi wrapper or just dealing directly with the Instructure API. Furthermore, there is still the issue of how might want to do deal with the concern that started this investigation off in the first place—namely, making sure no duplicate comments get uploaded if the script fails somewhere along the line in the whole upload process. Of course, writing a function with the plan to use it directly with the API (not through the wrapper) seems easy enough. When you query the Instructure API to look at the data that contains whether or not a comment on a submission has been entered, one gets a response that has a key, <code>submission_comments</code>, containing a list with a dictionary that has a sub-key, <code>comment</code>. It&rsquo;s easy to check the response, if it gives us an empty list, then there&rsquo;s no existing comment, otherwise it returns the actual comment already posted, along with other data, of course. Again, once we know where that information is, one can simply write some code to check it before uploading the comments—thus avoiding the possibility of duplicating comments. Something not all that sophisticated would seem to do the trick (one would just need to make sure they were hitting the right data—<code>submission_comment[0]['comment']</code> is the right spot to look and is what should be passed to the function below):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">check_if_comments_already_exist</span>(submission_comments_field):
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> submission_comments_field <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> []:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        updated <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">False</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span>:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        updated <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">True</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(updated)

<p>It strikes me as perhaps much easier to deal directly with the Instructure API rather than going through the wrapper. I suppose it&rsquo;s difficult to give some principled reason for preferring one over the other. I suppose one could invoke something like &ldquo;proximity&rdquo; and &ldquo;closeness&rdquo; in terms of an idea like &ldquo;mediation.&rdquo; Best to reduce the number of mediations in between where one is and where one wants to get to &hellip; something more to ponder and ruminate upon, to be sure.</p>

<h5 id="addendum-1-tuesday-17-january-2023">Addendum #1, Tuesday, 17 January 2023:</h5>
<p>After spending a couple of days working on writing some functions to handle all of this—included a big one that contains all of the sub-functions necessary to read in a datafile and then upload everything to the proper place, I found myself noticing an odd and peculiar little illusion in my thinking. I know that so much in data analytics and science is data wrangling, getting data into some kind of structured format that you can then do something with, obviously. One could say that the data coming from the Instructure API is incredibly well-structured. I think that&rsquo;s pretty much true. Thus, in working directly with the API, one doesn&rsquo;t need to do a ton of data wrangling, although you do have to do some, especially in terms of getting the data structured so that the API gets the data it&rsquo;s expected, i.e. like with the <code>grade_data['text_comment']</code> and <code>grade_data['posted_score']</code> dictionary keys, etc. But all in all, not much wrangling. Now, of course, when you use the ucfopen python wrapper, the data that&rsquo;s being utilized by the wrapper is just as structured as when you don&rsquo;t work through the wrapper. But for some reason, that feels not to be the case—and I really haven&rsquo;t the foggiest idea why.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not totally true—I think I do have some idea of why &hellip; maybe a simple example will suffice. When you want to get a list of users in a Canvas course, you can do the following to get the information via the canvasapi (and here I&rsquo;m just following the example from the official documentation <a href="https://canvasapi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html">here</a>):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>canvas <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> Canvas(API_URL, API_KEY)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>course <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> canvas<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>get_course(course_number)

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> user <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> all_users:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  print(user)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>What gets printed out is bare bones. You get a readout that looks something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>student_01_first_name student_01_middle_name student_01_last_name (student_id)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>student_02_first_name student_02_middle_name student_02_last_name (student_id)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>student_03_first_name student_03_middle_name student_03_last_name (student_id)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Of course, when going directly to the API, there&rsquo;s a richness of information, comparatively speaking, that the wrapper doesn&rsquo;t provide &hellip; which I&rsquo;m sure is by design, for sure. If one wants to dig deeper, then more function calls are in order. Maybe this all isn&rsquo;t that sophisticated. If one can get to their destination while only moving through one hoop (rather, than, say, another path that requires two or three of four hoops), then it would seem pretty to simple that the shorter route is preferable. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love the canvasapi library—it started me on many of journeys here on this Digital Forays blog, but I&rsquo;m seeing the usefulness of being able to take slightly more direct paths. It may not have anything at all to do—really—with the structured (or unstructured) nature of the data (as, in this case, the data is structured either way), bit perhaps more to do with how the data is being accessed &hellip; as I say, I&rsquo;ll have to continue stewing on this a bit more.</p>

I figured I would post some of the code to help out with this tiny little mini-project. (All the code for this is available in the following <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/syllabi_maker_stuff">repository</a>.)</p>
<p>I have a pretty simple <a href="https://www.instructure.com/canvas">Canvas</a> main page that has all the dates, readings, and assignments laid out in a simple little table—all on one main page:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_27/screenshot_1.png" alt="sample_table_from_canvas_page"></p>
<p>If the only thing about the syllabus that changes from semester to semester is the dates in the &ldquo;Day/Date&rdquo; column of the table, then we might want to write a little bit of code that&rsquo;ll help us generate a Markdown (.md) file with only the dates changed. We can then feed that .md file to <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> and have it converted to a simple html file that we can use in the Canvas LMS. Simple enough. Here&rsquo;s a simple [Jupyter notebook] that shows the logic to just get the dates changed. For those that read my <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-12-19-playing-around-with-chatgpt/">previous post</a>, they&rsquo;ll notice that the code in cell #4 was generated by ChatGPT. :)</p>
<p>We thus get a really nice little Markdown file that converts to an equally nice little <code>html</code> file:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_27/screenshot_2.png" alt="html_rendered_from_markdown_via_pandoc"></p>
<p>Further tweaks could be made if you&rsquo;ve got other information that needs to be changed from semester to semester (i.e. assignments, due dates, etc.) I haven&rsquo;t yet gotten the Canvas shell ported over from the previous semester, but it would be nice to also provide all of the links (to the readings or to the assignment pages) within the Markdown file as well. A task for another day, for sure!</p>
<p>I suppose—now that I think about it—I should actually go and see if there&rsquo;s a way to handle all of this natively from within the Canvas LMS. That said, I like to do it on my own first, so even if there&rsquo;s a way to do all from within Canvas, it&rsquo;s fun to try out solutions of one&rsquo;s own to the problem even when the system might already have a way to handle it. That too is no doubt a little journey for another time as well. I would imagine there&rsquo;s some setting when the courses are migrated from one semester shell to another to handle the date changes, but since this information is stored in an actual &ldquo;page&rdquo; of its own within the shell, I&rsquo;m not sure if there&rsquo;s a function to deal with that. I know there&rsquo;s a function to shift the &ldquo;due dates&rdquo; for assignments, but this content in the &ldquo;Reading Schedule&rdquo; table is in a slightly different spot &hellip; Ah, as I say: further sleuthing is in order!</p>
<p>(Update as of December 27th, 2022: A fuller treatment of all of the the above—including changes to the assignment links in the table—is available in a Jupyter notebook <a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/kspicer80/syllabi_maker_stuff/blob/main/sample_script.ipynb">here</a>.</p>

We all now how onerous it can be to create, say, a reading schedule with dates that we always need to shift when we move from one semester to another. (In the past, before learning how to solve/code this myself, I would run to that nice <a href="http://wcaleb.rice.edu/syllabusmaker/generic/">&ldquo;Syllabus Maker&rdquo;</a> tool courtsey of Caleb McDaniel and rely on it). I figured I would throw it a simple task to see what it came up. The question I posed was simple enough (and is simple enough for us lowly mortals who know how to code things like this ourselves, to be sure): &ldquo;How do I print out the date for every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday in a range of dates between January 11th and May 20th?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bot spit out the following code snippet utilizing Python&rsquo;s standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html">datetime library</a>, using a simple <code>while</code> loop:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_26/screenshot_1.png" alt="first_sceenshot"></p>
<p>What I also really liked about this was that if you switch up the language of the initial query, you get a slightly different answer. In the question about I didn&rsquo;t ask it to put the dates in a list, but simply to &ldquo;print out those dates.&rdquo; If you change it up slightly—&ldquo;How do I print out a list of dates for every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday in a range of dates between January 11th and May 20th?&quot;—you get the following (which utilizes the <a href="https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rrule.html"><code>rrule</code></a> function from the <code>dateutil</code> <a href="https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">library</a>)(there&rsquo;s always more than one to skin a cat, as one might say):</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_26/screenshot_2.png" alt="second_screenshot"></p>
<p>How cool is it that the thing produces code commentary as well? Really sick—that&rsquo;s for darn sure! Admittedly, pitching it a coding problem might not seem like all that hard of a pitch to hit out the park. Even still. I&rsquo;m greatly looking forward to continuing to play around with this thing.</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span>(combined_df)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Simple enough, we can then just call this function on all of the different century-named folders:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>df_1700s <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> read_jsons_into_dataframe(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;1700s)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After we do that for all four our centuries, we can just merge them all into one dataframe (oh—and after each of the four were read in we added a <code>label</code> column that had the century in it):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>merged_df <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> pd<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>concat([df_1700s, df_1800s, df_1900s, df_2000s])
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This gives us a nice dataframe with a shape of <code>(63347, 42)</code>. Each of the CourtListener files has columns for the <code>plain_text</code> of the case along with other columns that give us the same information in HTML: <code>html</code> and <code>html_with_citations</code>. We also need to create a <code>label</code> column that will store the century the case was written.</p>
<p>After some text cleaning using some of standard data cleaning functions, we could do a little teeny-tiny bit of exploratory EDA on our cleaned-up data:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_25/figure_1.png" alt="Figure 1"></p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_25/figure_2_value_counts_of_our_labels.png" alt="Figure 2"></p>
<p>Now, we do have a really sizable data imbalance—we have a ton more examples from the 1800s-2000s than we do from the 1700s. The way I decided to handle this was to simply sample the same number of documents from the 1800s, 1900s, and 2000s that we have for the 1700s—i.e. 135.</p>
<p>Next we can take all our cleaned-up opinions in our file and separate out the texts and the labels and then process them with spaCy using the <code>nlp</code> function (more information on and documentation about spaCy&rsquo;s TextCategorizer pipeline is available <a href="https://spacy.io/api/textcategorizer">here</a>). We&rsquo;ll write a simple little function to handle everything as follows:</p>

<p>Now we want to do some evaluating of the classifier model we&rsquo;ve created. I selected out a number of different opinions from each of the four centuries and ran them through the model (the full notebook is available <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/spacy_text_cat/blob/main/model_evaluation.ipynb">here</a>). One could easily clean-up the output here a little bit to make things easier to read—the model outputs numbers for each of the four classes, with a score 1.0 being a high likelihood that the opinion was from that century:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Actually, there&rsquo;s a nice little library available through <code>pip</code> that takes a dataframe and export it as a .png (see docs for <code>dataframe-image</code> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/dataframe-image/">here</a>):</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_25/test_table_png_file.png" alt="test_table_png_file"></p>
<p>That looks much nicer and way easier to read.</p>
<p>The model correctly classified 76% of the opinions correctly—13 out of 17. Not bad, I suppose. It would be interesting to see what would happen if we didn&rsquo;t deal with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/data-prep/construct/sampling-splitting/imbalanced-data">data imbalance</a> problem and simply fed it the 135 samples from the 1700s along with the full data from the 1800s, 1900s, and 2000s. Sounds like a nice little thing to check out when I get some more free time here.</p>
<p>More to come, as always, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>[Update as of Thursday, October 20th, 2022: Increasing the number of samples from the 1800s, 1900s, and 2000s did not result in any increase in terms of accuracy—still 13 out of 17.]</p>

I have improved things quite a bit and made the worfklow a whole lot easier. I figured I could, once again, take everyone through the steps to see if it might be at all helpful for others with similar use-cases. I know that, originally, I had really just wanted to produce some simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory">&ldquo;network graphs&rdquo;</a> that would keep track of the stories and authors that students were referencing in their posts each and every week. In that original post I was hard-coding each time a particular student made reference to a story/author (this quickly just became a simple part of my reading/grading workflow—as I graded and responded to student posts, I would note the authors they referenced in their posts), but I figured it would be nice to see if I couldn&rsquo;t automate this a little bit.</p>
<p>Again, we would love to end-up being able to produce a network graph that looks something like this (produced with <a href="https://gephi.org/">Gephi</a>), where all the nodes are the names of the texts and the posters and the edges illustrate when a poster refers to a text or to another&rsquo;s post:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_23/gephi_final_figure.png" alt="gephi final graph"></p>
<p>So the first thing we need to do is gather all of the data. Ideally, it would be nice to have some methods native to the Canvas Instructure LMS to download all of the Discussion Board posts from a particular Canvas course shell. At the moment of writing, there is still no way to do this simply using Canvas&rsquo;s tools, although, again, as seems quite usual and common for Canvas, <a href="(https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Question-Forum/Is-there-a-way-to-download-all-student-submissions-in-a-CANVAS/td-p/163333)">members of the community</a> have suggested adding such a feature to Instructure&rsquo;s offerings. Fortunately, there are some user-developed scripts that will allow one to grab all of the posts (the best Canvas Usercript for my purposes  is still available through <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/">TamperMonkey</a> <a href="https://breid.host.dartmouth.edu/userscripts/">here</a>). Once you run the script while in the &ldquo;Discussion Board&rdquo; assignment area of Canvas, you can get a <code>.csv</code> file that has all kinds of fantastic information and data in it. It will look something like the following (script to generate the fake data below is <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/solo_projects/blob/main/weird_fiction_visualizations/generating_fake_weird_fiction_data.py">here</a>):</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_23/csv_file_snip.PNG" alt=".csv datafile from TamperMonkey script"></p>
<p>Of course, the fake one above is already a little bit more cleaned-up than what one gets directly from the Userscript, but I think it&rsquo;ll work well-enough for our purposes here. As usual, we import our libraries and get our file read in properly:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, in my original workflow, I also had a list of all the student names stored in a dictionary, each keyed to a specific number—for the fake dataset I just ordinally-encoded each of the individual poster names in the <code>entry_id</code> and <code>reply_id</code> columns.</p>
<p>Ideally, what we would like to do is write a function to read through all of the text stirings in the <code>entry_message</code> and <code>reply_message</code> columns and extract out all of the mentions of any authors in our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weird#:~:text=The%20Weird%3A%20A%20Compendium%20of,by%20Ann%20and%20Jeff%20VanderMeer.&amp;text=Published%20on%2030%20Oct%202011,stories%2C%20novellas%20and%20short%20novels."><em>Weird Fiction</em></a> anthology. I coded a nice long list of all the authors in the anthology along with a list of &ldquo;aliases&rdquo; (shorter forms of the names, titles of the stories, etc.) to have our function search for and extract out of mentioned authors within each of the posts (the dictionary is <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/solo_projects/blob/main/weird_fiction_visualizations/author_names.py">here</a>).</p>
<p>I would like, here, at the outset, to thank <a href="https://jonreeve.com/">Jonathan Reeve</a> (yet again) over at Columbia for helping me think through the logic of this function (he personally corresponded with me via e-mail to assist me in getting this thing to do what I wanted). After importing the dictionary of author names, we define our function:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We can now take this and <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.apply.html?highlight=apply#pandas.DataFrame.apply">apply it to our dataframe</a>, creating a new column that will keep track of all the extracted author names mentioned in an individual post:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This gives us a new column with all the author mentions that we wanted. The function above returns a python dictionary (<code>dict</code>) object, so it would be nice to &ldquo;explode&rdquo; that dictionary and just get a list of the numbers (of the authors mentioned). But before we do that we just quickly reverse all the keys and values of the dictionary to get it how we want it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">convert_dict</span>(dictionary):

<p>Once we have everything that we want in the .csv we can then transfer it over to whatever network graphing or data visualization tool is the one of your choice (this format makes it easy to input into <a href="https://networkx.org/">NetworkX</a> or Gephi or <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> or what have you). Gephi was one of the very first digital humanities-esque libraries I got my hands dirty with, so I&rsquo;ve got a special place in my heart for it in particular. Of course, any of the other visualization libraries can handle this data without any trouble whatsoever (<a href="https://holoviews.org/">HoloViews</a> and <a href="https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/">bokeh</a> are great and, to be sure, <a href="https://plotly.com/">plotly</a> is also really nice for this as well—all of these libraries interface well with the NetworkX package too, so that can streamline things greatly, there&rsquo;s even <a href="https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.convert_matrix.from_pandas_edgelist.html">a function</a> in it that will read the list of edges directly from a pandas DataFrame object). In fact, if one would like to see some of the visualizations of all the semesters from my &ldquo;Weird Fiction&rdquo; course, there&rsquo;s a jupyter notebook available <a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/kspicer80/solo_projects/blob/main/weird_fiction_visualizations/bokeh_wf_visualizations.ipynb">here</a>. (A big thanks as well goes over to <a href="https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/06-Network-Analysis/02-Making-Network-Viz-with-Bokeh.html">Melanie Walsh</a> for helping me learn the bokeh visualizations.)</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a nice network graph of the simulated dataset:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_23/bokeh_plot_with_simulated_data.png" alt="simulated dataset graph"></p>
<p>In terms of future developments and improvements, it would be nice to see what else we could extract from the TamperMonkey script that downloads all of the discussion board data. I know recently (not sure how recently, to be honest) Canvas started counting the word lengths of all the posts. I can imagine all kinds of interesting questions one could pose to that data: what&rsquo;s the average number of words for an initial post, for a reply to another student&rsquo;s post, etc. You could even see if there were trends over time &hellip; does the average word count decrease as the semester slogs along and we get tired? Who are the individual students who write and write and write; who are the ones who are more parsimonious in their responses; and so on. As I say, lots of questions could be answered with that information and data. My initial desire was just to make it easier to see which authors in the anthology were the most popular—i.e. which ones did students mention most frequently, were these authors the same ones from semester to semester, year to year, etc. I now have things here where answering questions like these are simple: just pull the data down from Canvas, then feed it into the script, and then plot. Easy-breezy.</p>

I have a tendency to produce some rather extensive comments to student posts each and every week. As Canvas veterans know all too well, there are all kinds of things about Canvas that are frighteningly &ldquo;user-hostile,&rdquo; as <a href="http://www.robbyburns.com/blog/eliminating-canvas-stress-by-writing-content-in-markdown">Robby Burns puts it</a>. Just for myself, I would like to add just another thing that, as of late, has bugged me greatly. If one writes responses to student posts in Markdown (Burns doesn&rsquo;t explicitly suggest this, but I think of it as a nice extension of this line of thinking ), it&rsquo;s easy to get the Rich Context Editor in the discussion board area to take the Markdown without much of a  problem. If I want to, instead, respond directly not on the discussion board itself but in the &ldquo;Comments&rdquo; area of the SpeedGrader, it won&rsquo;t let me input any Markdown there, only plain text—heaven forbid someone wanted to put a link in the comments, one has to copy out the whole URL and cannot utilize the very simple syntax Markdown has for wrapping the link text in brackets, <code>[]</code>, followed by the full link in parentheses after it, <code>()</code>. Sigh. But I digress! Anyways, I wanted to find some way to be able to compose all of my responses to individual students in a separate file on my computer and not have to either copy and paste every single comment into the SpeedGrader for each and every student or, even worse, just use the native &ldquo;Comments&rdquo; box in SpeedGrader. Well, let&rsquo;s find a better way. I&rsquo;ve gone through a couple of iterations here with streamlining this whole grading workflow—and I thought I could post a little work-up here of my explorations.</p>
<p>The main library we&rsquo;re going to use here is <a href="https://github.com/ucfopen/canvasapi">a fantastic little wrapper</a> (available through <a href="https://pypi.org/project/canvasapi/">PIP</a>) that allows one to interact with <a href="https://canvasapi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">Canvas&rsquo;s own API</a> through Python. Before we get to the script that I use to quickly upload every single response for each individual student, we need to figure out how we want to store and structure the data we&rsquo;re going to be uploading. In the first iteration, I just put everything into a simple XML file that looked like this:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Simple enough, no? For some reason here this summer I thought that it was a tad-bit overkill to put it in an .xml format, which, <a href="https://www.toptal.com/web/json-vs-xml-part-1#:~:text=JSON%20is%20faster%20because%20it,more%20than%20just%20data%20interchange">as many have noted</a>, is better-suited for far more complex applications and situations than what I&rsquo;m up to here. The data I&rsquo;m storing is terribly simple here—just text—so it seemed to me like the .json format might be even better, easier, smoother &hellip; it also strikes me as much cleaner, no <code>&lt;&gt;</code> and no tags, just simple quotation marks, semicolons, commas, etc. Both file formats work perfectly well, but I found myself preferring the .json here recently, though I&rsquo;m not exactly sure why.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So the remaining steps in the procedure so far are really easy. We put all of the data we want to upload to our Canvas shell for students in the very same file. The other information you need in order to get this to work (e.g. the &ldquo;course_number&rdquo; and the &ldquo;assignment_id&rdquo; are available in the URL when you navigate to the actual assignment in question&rsquo;s SpeedGrader) is also easy enough to grab. So, for example, the URL for Harry&rsquo;s submission above will look something like this (one would just change-up the main address for one&rsquo;s own particular school/institution):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>https://learn.stfrancis.edu/courses/9999999/gradebook/speed_grader?assignment_id=1111111<span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">&amp;</span>student_id=00000000
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After we have all our responses to all of our students&rsquo; submissions ready to go and in the same file, we can write the script that will upload everything for us to the LMS shell with just a single click of a button. (Honestly, I&rsquo;m still amazed that one can get all of this so simplified and streamlined with just a few lines of code—it&rsquo;s fantastic.) Before we feed data through the API, we need to obtain an API key (the main documentation for this via Instructure is <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/file.oauth.html">here</a> and there is man even more simplified version available <a href="https://kb.iu.edu/d/aaja">here</a>). Once we have our API Key we can get to importing our libraries and code some stuff!</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>With our necessary libraries all imported and tailored how we want them, we can set up some variables to store the URL of the Canvas shell, the API Key, etc.:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>API_URL <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;https://learn.stfrancis.edu&#39;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now we can instantiate a Canvas object with the canvasapi library—and call the <code>get_course()</code> function which will allow us to interact with the individual course.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>canvas <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> Canvas(API_URL, API_KEY)

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The canvasapi library has all kinds of fantastic functions—most of which I haven&rsquo;t even really played around with yet. Let&rsquo;s say you wanted to get all of the ids of all the students in a section (those numbers would go in the <code>student_id</code> of our .json file, by the way)—simple enough:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>students_in_course <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> course<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>get_users(enrollment_type<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;student&#39;</span>])
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> user <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> students_in_course:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(user)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Want all the individual assignment_id numbers? Again, too easy:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>all_assignments <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> course<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>get_assignments()

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    print(assignment)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Okay, so now we want the real meat here, the process where we write some code to iterate through all of the data in the .json file and then post the data in the appropriate places in the Canvas shell. Again, just a few lines of pandas syntax in a very simple <code>for loop</code> gets us exactly what we want. First we read the .json file into a dataframe (you need not do it this way—of course, you could just read the .json data into a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries">python dictionary</a>—<code>dict()</code>—and then iterate through all the keys and values in that)—:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>df <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> pd<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>read_json(filename_path, orient<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;split&#39;</span>)

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Done and done—all of the individualized responses and grades for each and every student will be uploaded to Canvas, all in just a few lines of code.</p>
<p>There are, to be sure, some improvements that I can imagine someone wanting. For instance, the code above assumes that you do not have any rubrics attached to any of the assignments. It would be nice, if one did like to use the Canvas rubrics feature, to be able to structure the .json file so that you could score each of the criteria that are present in a rubric (this endpoint of the Instructure API has not been implemented yet, <a href="https://github.com/ucfopen/canvasapi/issues/538">but I did suggest it</a>). As <a href="(https://github.com/ucfopen/canvasapi/discussions/537)">Brian noted over on the canvasapi repo</a>, there is a way to do this going straight through Instructure&rsquo;s API, but I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to fiddle and tinker with that just yet.</p>
<p>I find that this whole process has really streamlined things for me—I hated having to copy and paste; I also love being able to keep all of my responses to all of the students&rsquo; posts in the very same file; it definitely makes it easier for me to remember exactly what I wrote to other students: I can thus weave together different responses, reuse some boilerplate when necessary (I usually include a similar &ldquo;greeting&rdquo; or salutation to each student before actually responding to their post, so it&rsquo;s easy to copy and paste from one entry to another, etc.) I find the whole things allows me to individualize everything still for students while also reducing my workflow with things that used to take a pretty good deal of time &hellip;</p>
<p>All in all, a nice little project that will continue to save me a great deal of time in the future, that&rsquo;s for sure—and I look forward to seeing what I can do with feeding data directly into the rubric for an assignment (especially when one checks that little box that says something like &ldquo;Use Rubric for Assignment Grading,&rdquo; which would mean we could remove the <code>score</code> part of the .json file above and then create separate lines for each of the individual criteria of the rubric).</p>

<p>(All of the code for this post is available in this repo <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/acb_opinion_topic_modeling">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Continuing off of the last two posts (<a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-07-06-topic-modeling-the-ussc_19/">here</a> and <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-07-07-top2vec-topic-modeling_20/">here</a>), I thought we might continue seeing what we could do with our Supreme Court Opinions dataset(s)—I was also fascinated and inspired by a nice little article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideological_leanings_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_justices">Wikipedia</a> about the &ldquo;Ideological leanings of United States Supreme Court justices,&rdquo; which has some really nice images. I thought one might do a little exploratory work with the opinions of some of the more recently appointed Justices: in particular I wanted to look at the work done so far by Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett; perhaps a little PCA work to see if we could work through any potential stylistic similarities between their opinions so far. Given that none of the opinions by these newer Justices are in either of our USSC datasets (either from the <a href="(https://www.humanitiesdataanalysis.org/topic-models/notebook.html)">Karsdorp, et. al. work</a> or from the dataset available on <a href="(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gqfiddler/scotus-opinions)">Kaggle</a>), we&rsquo;ll have to do some data wrangling/scraping. We&rsquo;ll focus in on utilizing the data gathered through the really awesome <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/">Court Listener website</a>. I thought I would try to take us through all the steps I went through in order to pull down these Justices&rsquo; opinions. There are, of course, some things I figured out along the way to make the whole process a little more streamlined, but I&rsquo;ll go through the non-streamlined paths and will try to show the spots where we could simplify things a good deal. (The more streamlined versions are available in the <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a> below.)</p>
<h2 id="data-wranglinggatheringweb-scraping-process">Data Wrangling/Gathering/Web Scraping Process</h2>
<p>So, for starters we went to Court Listener&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/">main page</a> and searched by the &ldquo;Supreme Court&rdquo; field, looking for all the opinions authored by Justice Kavanaugh. Next we loaded up some libraries:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, obviously, <a href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">BeautifulSoup (BS4)</a> has functions that will automate this for us, but on this first run I went down the old-fashioned copy-and-paste route. So how do we scrape the information that we want from the pages that have the opinions? We should try some things out just on a single case before we go trying to grab all of the opinions we want, so here we avail ourselves of the BS4 parser:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>test_grab <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> requests<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>get(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4581379/henry-schein-inc-v-archer-white-sales-inc/?type=o&amp;type=o&amp;order_by=score+desc&amp;judge=Kavanaugh&amp;stat_Precedential=on&amp;court=scotus&amp;page=1&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>soup <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> BeautifulSoup(test_grab<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>content, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;html.parser&#39;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There is some specific information that we want to scrape off the web page—it would be nice to have things like the &ldquo;Docket Number&rdquo; of the case, perhaps the year the opinion was registered, the name of the case, what kind of opinion it was (<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/slipopinion/21">Slip</a>, etc.), and so on. Thus, we need to inspect the html to see where all this information resides. We can see, as an example, that the &ldquo;Docket Number&rdquo; is in the following block of HTML (so that let&rsquo;s us know exactly what we want our script to look for):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">p</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;bottom&#34;</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">span</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;meta-data-header&#34;</span>&gt;Docket Number:&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">span</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">span</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">class</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;meta-data-value&#34;</span>&gt;21-429&gt;&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">span</span>&gt;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>&lt;/<span style="color:#f92672">p</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So, what we want to do is write some code for BS4 to look for the above and pull the information from there. BS4 gives us all this nice functionality to, in our test case here, locate all of the information within a specific HTML tag using the <a href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html?highlight=find_all#find-all"><code>find_all</code> function</a>. So let&rsquo;s grab all the spans that we&rsquo;re looking for here:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>spans <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> soup<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>find_all(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;span&#39;</span>, {<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;class&#39;</span>: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;meta-data-value&#39;</span>})
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(spans[<span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>]<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>get_text())
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The<a href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html?highlight=get_text(#get-text)"><code>get_text</code> function</a> will return us just the text within each of the span tags. The titles of the cases are contained within a different tag (and there&rsquo;s only one of them on the page, so we can use the <a href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html?highlight=find()#find"><code>find()</code></a> method instead of <code>find_all</code>): <code>case_title = soup.find(&quot;meta&quot;, {'property': &quot;og:title&quot;})</code></p>
<p>Furthermore, the type of opinion can be found thusly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>opinion_type_soup <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> soup<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>find(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;pre&#39;</span>, {<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;class&#39;</span>: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;inline&#39;</span>})<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>get_text()
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>match <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> opinion_type_soup[opinion_type_soup<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>find(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;(&#39;</span>)<span style="color:#f92672">+</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>:opinion_type_soup<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>find(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;)&#39;</span>)]
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The type of opinion is also put within a set of parentheses, so we can just use a simple regex (following the method given <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/python-regex-to-return-string-between-parentheses/#:~:text=The%20simplest%20way%20to%20extract,like%20so%3A%20s%5Bs.">here</a>) to extract only the text within the parentheses, as we don&rsquo;t really need it the open and closing parenthesis.</p>
<p>Now we should be able to put all of this into a <code>for loop</code> so that we can grab everything that we want and then feed it into a dataframe. First we initialize empty lists to store all of the data, run the loop to grab all the info we want and then append it all to the individual lists—once that&rsquo;s all done we&rsquo;ll create a dataframe from all of the lists.</p>

<p>Now that we have everything working here for Kavanaugh&rsquo;s opinions, it&rsquo;s simple enough to just rinse and repeat with all the opinions by Gorsuch and Barrett. We thus end up with three different dataframes that we can <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.concat.html">concatenate together</a> into a single one. We&rsquo;ll also <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_json.html?highlight=to_json#pandas.DataFrame.to_json">output the dataframe to a .jsonl</a> file for further analysis and so that we don&rsquo;t constantly query the Court Listener website each time:</p>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve got everything wrangled together into a single dataframe, what might we want to do with this now that it&rsquo;s in a form that&rsquo;s ready for analysis? As noted in the introductory section above, what if we do a little bit of visualization of the three Justices&rsquo;s writing styles? Actually, before we move into running through this some algorithms, let&rsquo;s do a teensy-tiny bit of cleaning of data in the dataframe, as we definitely have some things we won&rsquo;t want to utilize (new lines [\n], for example, in the <code>text</code> column). Thus, let&rsquo;s do a little text cleanup (following Susan Li&rsquo;s nice little gist and function <a href="https://gist.github.com/susanli2016/29d4cf9b7db4c6804e174b8eac2891e8">here</a>)</p>

This time around I felt like using <a href="https://plotly.com/python/">Plotly library</a> largely because I wanted to learn and play around with it a little bit more (I feel pretty confident with [Matplotlib] (<a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index.html">https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index.html</a>) and figure it might be nice to try a new graphing library). We can very easily get the word counts for the <code>text</code> column as follows: <code>df['num_words'] = df.text.apply(lambda x: len(x.split()))</code>. Then it&rsquo;s a simple call to plot the histogram: <code>fig = px.histogram(df, x='num_words', color='authors', title='Number of Words per Case by Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett')</code>:</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s continue down the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">PCA</a> route and see what we can see. As usual, we need to vectorize the texts and we, again, as per usual, will use that handy ol&rsquo; <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html">sklearn library</a>. After the imports we&rsquo;ll create and initialize a PCA object, fit and transform the <code>df['text']</code> column, and then set up a <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html?highlight=decisiontreeclassifier#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier"><code>DecisionTreeClassifier()</code></a> (for more information on the use of PCA before utilizing the decision tree function, hop over <a href="https://dorukkilitcioglu.com/2018/08/11/pca-decision-tree.html">here</a>):</p>

<p>So we see the algorithm finding a good deal of similarity between opinions by these three justices. We could also wonder a little bit what things would look like if we added some Justices on the opposite side of the ideological spectrum. What if we added opinions by Sotomayor and Kagan to the plot?</p>
<p>That would give us a plot that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_21/pca_analysis_of_all_five_justices.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Oh—and we can easily get the word counts, of course:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_21/num_words_by_all_five_authors.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We could—also—do a similar analysis with the very large <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gqfiddler/scotus-opinions">Kaggle dataset</a> as well. That too is simple enough with all the functions we&rsquo;ve got so far (stand-alone notebook with all the code is available directly from <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/recent_ussc_justices_opinions_topic_modeling/blob/main/all_opinions_pca.ipynb">here</a>).</p>
<p>The main parameter that we passed to the <code>PCA()</code> function of <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/decomposition.html#pca">scikitlearn</a> called <code>n_components</code> is one we could tweak a little bit. We could also utilize the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.explained_variance_score.html?highlight=explained_variance#sklearn.metrics.explained_variance_score"><code>explained_variance_score</code> metric</a> as well to see exactly how much variance is explained by the number of components utilized (for more info on this head <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/principal-component-analysis-pca-with-scikit-learn-1e84a0c731b0">this way</a>):</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_21/pca_variance_explained.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_21/pca_on_all_opinions.png" alt=""></p>
<p>My guess is that this clustering is due to the very domain-specific area that we&rsquo;re working with here: namely, the legal system. It makes sense that most of the opinions would be found to be quite similar to one given the shared genre. It would be curious to see what the plots looked like when we tried texts from quite different genres. Sounds like an idea for another project!</p>
<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>
<p>We can definitely do a little bit of pruning with the scraping functions—and I thought I could lay out the logic of that here in the Appendix.  For one thing, rather than copy and pasting all of the links on each results&rsquo; page from Court Listener, one should write some code that will head to each of the returned results pages, pull down all the links on each page, and then move on from there. In other words, we could put the results&rsquo; pages (there were three in total) for all of Justices Sotomayor&rsquo;s and Kagan&rsquo;s opinions into lists:</p>

We can even go a step further and wrap all this work in some functions.

As is so often the case, I came across this library via Dr. William Mattingly&rsquo;s YoutTube channel, who devoted two different videos to using this library (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEaxKSQ4Av8">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmWI3xu9SII">here</a>). So let&rsquo;s jump in and see what we can do with this library.</p>
<p>This time around we&rsquo;re using a slightly different dataset that comes Kaggle—<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gqfiddler/scotus-opinions">it contains</a> all of the USSC opinions from 1970 on. So let&rsquo;s load up some libraries and get everything read in as usual. Top2Vec needs a list of strings to process and vectorize, so we&rsquo;ll convert the dataframe column that contains the texts of the opinions (the .csv file has a column named <code>text</code> that we&rsquo;ll use) into a list:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> pandas <span style="color:#66d9ef">as</span> pd

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then it&rsquo;s just a simple call to get a model built: <code>top2vec_model = Top2Vec(docs) </code>. Given that there are around 10,000 unique values for the <code>text</code> column, the model took quite a while to get everything processed—of course, one can easily save the model for further work by calling <code>top2vec_model.save</code> and passing a filename. Once everything was processed, we can get the vectors for all of the documents in the .csv: <code>vectors = top2vec_model._get_document_vectors()</code>. We can also see how many different &ldquo;topics&rdquo; the model has found in our dataset—in our case the model found 158 different topics. We can also get all the key words and terms associated with each distinct topic by calling the <code>top2vec_model.get_num_topics() </code> function. In our case we end up with 157 different topics. We can also see how many different documents within the dataset get clustered together into a topic (see &ldquo;The size of the topics found is:&rdquo; line below).</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Thus, topic clusters 51 (which we already knew about), 100, 46, 4, etc. have a preponderance of the word &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; in the documents contained within that cluster. What if we tried to visualize all the topics to see what we could see? Following the <a href="https://github.com/ddangelov/Top2Vec/blob/master/README.md">Top2Vec documentation</a>, we can use the <a href="https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">UMAP library</a> to get the data into a format (a 2-dimensional) that will allow us to produce a scatterplot of all the topics. First we perform the reduction and then we set up some umap_args for the plot. Following some work by uoneway (the function is available in <a href="https://github.com/ddangelov/Top2Vec/pull/120/commits/8a59538f63c55215eda3a366dcf7f80216f56f7c">this</a> pull request), we can use their <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/ussc_topic_modeling_playground/blob/main/testing_generate_documents_plot_function.py">super-handy function</a> to visually map out all the topic clusters. We can simply call that function in order to produce a plot of everything following—<code>generate_documents_plot()</code> very simply gives us this plot:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_20/all_top2vec_topics_scatterplot.png" alt="umap_plot_of_clusters"></p>
<p>We can see towards the bottom right side of the plot that some of our key topics, 51, 100, 46, 4, are clustered in that quadrant of the graph. If we zero-in a bit we can see them laid out fairly &ldquo;close&rdquo; to one another:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_20/zeroing_in_on_topics_51_100_46.png" alt="zeroed_in_umap_plot"></p>
<p>(For both images one can right-click &rsquo;em, open in a new tab and then zoom in—I&rsquo;ll have to see if I can find a nice HUGO shortcode that would do this without having to load the image in a new tab &hellip;—I know there is some <a href="https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/issues/384">talk out there</a> of potentially implmenting a <a href="https://medium.com//">Medium.com</a> like zoom on images too.)</p>
<p>I would say that after all of the model building is completed (which, again, did take quite a while given the rather large size of our dataset), the steps needed are super quick and simple—and the ease with which all of this happens after model building is nothing short of really awesome. I am greatly looking forward to playing around with this library on all kinds of different datasets, that&rsquo;s for sure! (As Dr. Mattingly noted in his <a href="(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmWI3xu9SII)">second video</a>, there are some parameters in Top2Vec [specifically the <a href="https://top2vec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html">&ldquo;speed&rdquo; and &ldquo;workers&rdquo;</a> ones] that could potentially speed up different parts of the process) that I should tweak and play around with a little bit to see what the effects are in the final visualizations and clustering of topics. More to come on this front, to be sure!</p>

<p>Friday of last week, June 24th, 2022, was a profoundly dark day for a great many of us in the United States. Feeling somewhat helpless as the Supreme Court published the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf">final draft</a> of <em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women&rsquo;s Health Organization</em>, I couldn&rsquo;t help but fall back on old patterns. Not really knowing what else to do—I had a student with whom I had recently read the leaked original draft posted by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/read-justice-alito-initial-abortion-opinion-overturn-roe-v-wade-pdf-00029504">Politico</a>—I couldn&rsquo;t help but say to her when the opinion came down that I didn&rsquo;t know what else to do other than to get to reading. There&rsquo;s something about the academic position—&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get started reading &hellip;&quot;—that felt so weak to me at the moment in the face of all the implications and consequences of this huge decision, but, honestly, I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure what else to do other than to go to the default thing that the academic does: read &hellip; and think. Last Friday was a very dark day for sure; as I heard one commentator say (who exactly escapes me at the moment), it isn&rsquo;t every day that you can wake up and can see that your daughter literally has fewer rights on that day than her own mother or grandmother had over all the decades since 1973. &ldquo;A dark day&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t even really capture things.</p>
<p>I read the draft decision multiple times—twice, in fact (or was it a f three times?)—; I read the finalized version of the opinion along with the concurring and dissenting opinions, again, twice. I figured this might be as good an opportunity as any to try out some of the things I&rsquo;ve learned recently working with the whole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model">topic modeling</a> area of NLP and machine learning in general.</p>

<p><em>Humanities Data Analysis: Case Studies with Python</em> by Folgert Karsdorp, Mike Kestemont, and Allen Riddell (a fantastically awesome text, by the way, I should say!) has an entire chapter that would seem perfectly fine for our purposes here. Chapter 9, &ldquo;A Topic Model of United States Supreme Court Opinions, 1900-2000,&rdquo; has a ton of the data that we would want to be looking at here with regards to thinking about the <em>Dobbs</em> decision. Karsdorp, et. al. has a <a href="https://www.humanitiesdataanalysis.org/topic-models/notebook.html">dataset with a .jsonl file</a> with a ton of Supreme Court opinions separated by author name, case_id, the type of opinion, and the year the opinion was submitted.

In terms of conclusions one might draw here—especially the graph showing the rolling 3-year window, one could easily say that a marked increase in documents showing a concern with topics surrounding women, medical care, abortion, viability, and other connected ideas (&ldquo;child and children,&rdquo; &ldquo;care&rdquo;, &ldquo;hospital,&rdquo; &ldquo;family,&rdquo; and so on) occur right around the time of the <em>Roe</em> decision. Of course, I would want to suggest that the plots above are a perfectly empirical, &ldquo;data-driven&rdquo; way to talk about the United States&rsquo;s history with regards to women and their concerns. The main opinion from Justice Alito talked a big game about the use of a proper historical understanding of the whole &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; issue. Another part of that history, too, of course, is a quite profound lack of interest in women&rsquo;s equality. That too, sadly to say, is also a part of this whole &ldquo;history&rdquo; and for many of us what the <em>Dobbs</em> decision did was, unfortunately, to simply continue that larger trend of disregard for women&rsquo;s equality.</p>
<p>I was planning to show how the <a href="https://github.com/ddangelov/Top2Vec">Top2Vec library</a>) handles all of this, but this post is getting a bit on the long side; I was also hoping to post some stylometric analysis of three of the recently-new justices (Gorusch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett), but I&rsquo;ll save that for yet another post. So, two more posts to come on this arena here in the near future.</p>
<p>(<em>Nota bene</em>: It would probably also be nice to update the .csv file/database with opinions that occurred after 2016, bringing them more up-to-date. I&rsquo;ll see if I can write-up something about using the really fantastic <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk-info/">Court Listener</a> API to fetch the plain text of the opinions from the years between 2016 and 2022.)</p>

I myself have been thinking quite a bit about what&rsquo;s in the just mentioned post, especially with regards to &ldquo;finding datasets&rdquo; for machine learning that would be nicer test cases for those of us working with machine learning within the context(s) of the humanities. No doubt one can learn a ton about the whole linear regression method when charting stock prices of sales at a restaurant or other scenarios where linear regression would be a helpful methodology of study and analysis. The [UCI Machine Learning Repository] has fantastic things up on it, but, as the Ninja notes, datasets tailored towards the humanities are perhaps pretty sparse (there is a <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Victorian+Era+Authorship+Attribution">&ldquo;Victorian Era Authorship Attribution Data Set&rdquo;</a>) that is promising, but, as I say, good datasets are perhaps few and far between.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I have been working my way through Émile Zola&rsquo;s 1885 novel, <em>Germinal</em>. I thought it might be interesting to see if I could find some data on French coal production. That led me down a rather nice rabbit hole of sorts where I learned about <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/free-data-iea">how difficult it is</a> to get energy data from the IEA (<a href="https://www.iea.org/">International Energy Agency</a>). I was able to find some data on the St. Louis FRED <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/">site</a>. There were a couple of datasets available <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A01214FRA422NNBR">here</a> and <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M01191FRM580NNBR">here</a>].</p>
<p>A gist for the following three plots is available <a href="https://gist.github.com/kspicer80/5faed2dd26d1cd09df75fc2901bdfda3">here</a> along with the dataset in .csv format.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s nice about the solution provided by <a href="https://zwbetz.com">Zachary Wade Betz</a> is that it&rsquo;s quite easy to add data to the file that then gets fed into the table in the post. So, I haven&rsquo;t looked at every single Henry James text—if there were more in the future, it would be easy enough to add those texts to a script and then let the computer take care of the rest, ultimately updating the table easily enough.</p>
<p>More to come, no doubt &hellip;</p>

I thought I would post a little bit more here of what I&rsquo;ve been up to as of late with this. A student of mine was fascinated by the use of the words &ldquo;prodigious&rdquo; and &ldquo;portentous&rdquo; in the Governess&rsquo;s narrative in <em>Turn</em>. She said she noticed it frequently. It makes sense that these words would be in the Governess&rsquo;s narrative, given her penchant for playing the detective (or the psychoanalyst), always trying to read the signs pointing to forbidden knowledge. But how often does she use these words? Let&rsquo;s write some code, make some graphs, and figure it out.</p>
<p>First things first, let&rsquo;s have a look-see at the <a href="https://www.nltk.org/">NLTK library</a> for some basic word counts/<a href="https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.draw.dispersion.html#module-nltk.draw.dispersion">lexical dispersion plots</a>.</p>
<p>A simple use of the <a href="https://www.nltk.org/howto/concordance.html"><code>nltk.text.concordance</code></a>  function can give us a nice print out of a specific range of tokens within the text that has the word in question.</p>

<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_16/concordance_for_prodigious.png" alt="Concordance output for &amp;ldquo;prodigious&amp;rdquo;"></p>
<p>An equally simple call of the <code>dispersion_plot</code> NLTK function gives us an image of where the word appears in the text as a whole:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>plt<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>figure(figsize<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>(<span style="color:#ae81ff">12</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">9</span>))

<p>Of course, we can plot them both on the same figure if we like:</p>

<p>We could also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation">lemmatize</a> the text <a href="https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/stem/wordnet.html">beforehand</a> and see if we get any more words hitting our target list (here we&rsquo;ll just provide a list of lemmas to search for, find, and then plot):</p>

<p>After a bunch of conversations with my student about these words, I thought it might be curious to see how the frequency of these words compare over a larger selection of James&rsquo;s corpus. Easy enough—I grabbed all the texts I could from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/113">Project Gutenberg by James</a>. (A .json file with all of the counts of the target words per text is available directly from <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/henry_james/blob/main/makenzies_target_word_counts.json">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Again, some very simple <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/henry_james/blob/main/prodigious_and_portentous_counts.py">Python code</a> can give us counts of these words and lemmas across multiple works by James:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_16/prodigious_and_portentous_counts_across_james_corpus.png" alt="Counts across James&amp;rsquo;s Corpus"></p>
<p>We can see that the frequency of some of these words go over the course of time; we also see that the counts for <em>Turn</em> are also pretty high, especially for &ldquo;prodigious.&rdquo; More to come on this, for sure, as I would like to write a post dealing with the motif of repetition in the story and a pretty simple and straightforward script to count repetitions of tokens over the entirety of the novella.</p>
<p>(All the code for this post is available in this <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/henry_james">repo</a>.)</p>

<p>Doing some research for a favorite student of mine, I&rsquo;ve been wandering around websites devoted to law school. One website <a href="https://blog.powerscore.com/lsat/top-100-law-school-application-deadlines-2022-edition/">here</a> has a really fantastic little table on the page that has everything one could want—especially if one is a little behind on deadlines and trying to catch up a bit (i.e. figuring out which schools will allow students to start in the Spring or Summer semesters [for an answer to that query, head over <a href="https://blog.powerscore.com/lsat/bid-153623-which-law-schools-offer-spring-and-summer-starts/">here</a>]). Now, of course, one could just do the simple ol&rsquo; copy and paste of the table, but we all know how ornery things can get when one tries to paste it into Word or some other program and having to deal with all the formatting shenanigans—indeed, copy and pasting ends up with something like the following:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_15/copy_and_pasting_html_tables.PNG" alt="Ugly Copy and Pasting"></p>
<p>Rather than worry with that whole mess, why don&rsquo;t we write a little code to get the thing into a nice format, maybe a simple Markdown table since the <code>.md</code> file extension seems to be my new best friend since getting into all this fantastically cool DH stuff?</p>
<p>First things we had a look at the html for the page, using the &ldquo;View Page Source&rdquo; function in Chrome after right-clicking on the page. Looking for a <code>table id</code> of some kind, sure, enough, here it is:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_15/inspecting_the_html.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I also want to give a big shoutout to Thiago Santos Figueira&rsquo;s very clear and simple <a href="https://medium.com/geekculture/web-scraping-tables-in-python-using-beautiful-soup-8bbc31c5803e">Medium post</a> on using Beautiful Soup to parse content in tables. His use case is a little bit complicated as it cleans up some of the numbers in the table in question there, so we can fiddle a little bit and grab only what we want. So for the script, we get all the required libraries imported along with some pandas customizations:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">from</span> bs4 <span style="color:#f92672">import</span> BeautifulSoup

This has been in partnership with my current institution&rsquo;s College of Education, the <a href="https://www.stfrancis.edu/real/courses/">&ldquo;REAL Academy&rdquo;</a> and it has been quite a whirlwind road, lots of fun, lots of work, lots of opportunity for me to learn all kinds of new things. Here in the first module of the Summer semester I am running the ENGE/ENGM515 course focused on &ldquo;Digital Rhetoric.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re barely a week into the seminar here, but already I&rsquo;ve having quite a bit of fun. We&rsquo;re hoping to look at som fairly canonical texts—Douglas Eyman&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.press.umich.edu/4536325/digital_rhetoric"><em>Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, and Practice</em></a>, Collin Gifford Brooke&rsquo;s <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Lingua_Fracta.html?id=5CgLAQAAMAAJ"><em>Lingua Fracta: Towards a Rhetoric of New Media</em></a>, and much, much more. I quite like Brooke&rsquo;s text, especially since it pulls very few punches and still strikes me as incredibly relevant in its overall argument and claim, namely, that those of us working in rhetoric and composition need to attend to the computational/digital infrastructures that allow us to do what it is that we do in the classroom with writing. Case in point, here is Brooke in the &ldquo;Coda&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I find it increasingly irresponsible to study rhetoric and writing without accounting in some way for the various impacts of information and communication technologies. Likewise, I do not think that it is possible to understand these technologies without an appreciation of their rhetorical effects, both qua technology and as players in our discursive ecologies. (p. 197)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with such a position—although, for myself, I am wondering just exactly how far down the rabbit hold I want to go in terms of &ldquo;accounting &hellip; for the various impacts of information and communication technologies&rdquo; when we think about and study rhetoric. This very quickly (and easily?) gets one into questions of literacy. I am, of course, sympathetic to the whole analogy that sees literacy with the digital as being similar to the early days of the automobile. If one was driving an old Model T, it would behoove one to (possibly) know how it worked; over time, I can drive the car without worrying myself too much how exactly an internal combustion engine works. The same could be said for the computer. That said, now that I&rsquo;ve learned how to code, how to program, how to script things, I can&rsquo;t really ever imagine how I lived without such knowledge and awareness.</p>
<p>Speaking of analogies, I found Brooke&rsquo;s use of the &ldquo;interface&rdquo; metaphor to be incredibly thought-provoking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For better of worse, there is no explicit focus in this project on pedagogy, although I believe that there are some obvious classroom implications for many of the examples I offer. One of the equally obvious implications of the increasing trend toward online education is that we have begun to think of our classrooms, whether f2f or online, as interfaces as well, and in that sense, the writing classroom may ultimately take its place among the media I describe in this project. But there are no direct pedagogical consequences to this project other than its attitudes toward rhetoric and technology (pp. 199-200).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this idea of trying to think about the classroom as a kind of &ldquo;interface&rdquo;—very interesting. Would it help us teachers to incorporate the language of &ldquo;usability&rdquo; and &ldquo;user-testing&rdquo; when we think about our presence and time in the classroom (especially in terms of courses that are &ldquo;face-to-face&rdquo;!) &hellip; I like this a lot and will definitely chew on this a bit more, to be sure!</p>
<p>No doubt this assertion is cousin to some of the larger arguments Brooke puts forward with regards to thinking about technologies and how they impact the teaching of writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our tendency has been to treat discursive technologies as if they were simply another specialty among many in our discipline, the province of a handful of experts, one of whom could be hired into a department thereby satisfying that particular &ldquo;area.&rdquo; This attitude, another of our legacies inherited from English departments, has left us underprepared for the shift from page to screen; technology is transdisciplinary, cutting across the full range of activities we engage in as professionals, rather than subdisciplinary. The longer we wait to realize this, the harder we will have to struggle for respect and relevance as experts in writing. (p. 5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My two colleagues (<a href="https://bethmcdermott.com/">Drs. Beth McDermott</a> and <a href="https://annaioanes.com/">Anna Ioanes</a>) in the English Department have just finished a year-long grant project—generously funded by the <a href="https://www.avdf.org/">Arthur Vining Davis Foundation</a> where they were interested in studying this &ldquo;digital technology&rdquo; side of things here at the <a href="https://www.stfrancis.edu">University of St. Francis</a>. The final report would appear to lend a great deal of credence to Brooke&rsquo;s argument that we really do have our feet to the fire when it comes to thinking more carefully and intentionally about the technological side of writing instruction. The creation of graduate-level courses in Multimodal Composition and Digital Rhetoric (of course) is a really fantastic start—though I have no doubt that there&rsquo;s still much more to be done, especially at the undergraduate level.</p>
<p>I am also thinking that I myself need to do a little bit more thinking in terms of this whole &ldquo;digital&rdquo; or &ldquo;data literacy&rdquo; (Codecademy&rsquo;s recent <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science-nlp">offering</a> of a Data Scientist Track in NLP got me thinking about this whole &ldquo;data literacy&rdquo; issue) versus having a facility with digital tools and digital making. I can imagine someone having fantastic data literacy but not knowing at all how to make, say, a graph in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> or <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> with <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> or <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>. It&rsquo;s possible one could argue that data literacy is an absolutely necessary thing; knowing how to code and create the graphs might not be all that necessary at the end of the day, sufficient but ultimately not necessary. As usual, one sees how the overall goals and purposes of one&rsquo;s endeavors have a great deal of significance here—which is, of course, good rhetorical practice in general.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to keep this space here on the blog up-to-date as the semester goes along—as always, more to come!</p>

    <h3>Prologue:</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>
      <font color="teal">The story had held us,</font> round the <font color="maroon">fire,</font> sufficiently breathless, but except the obvious
      remark that it was gruesome, as, on <font color="GreenYellow">Christmas
        Eve</font> in an old house, a strange tale should essentially be, I
      remember no comment uttered till somebody happened to say that it was the
      only case he had met in which such a visitation had fallen on a child. <font color="mistyrose">The case,</font> I may mention, was that of an
      apparition in just such an old house as had gathered us for the occasion—an
      appearance, of a dreadful kind, to a little boy sleeping in the room with
      his mother and waking her up in the terror of it; waking her not to
      dissipate his dread and soothe him to sleep again, but to encounter also,
      herself, before she had succeeded in doing so, the same sight that had <font color="teal">shaken him.</font>
      It was this observation that drew from Douglas—not immediately, but <font color="Olive">later in the
        evening</font>—a reply that had the interesting consequence to which I
      call attention. Someone else told a story not particularly effective, <font color="magenta">which I saw he was not following.</font> This I
      took for a sign that he had himself something to produce and that we should
      only have to wait. We waited in fact till <font color="GreenYellow">two nights
        later</font>; but that before we scattered, he brought out what was in
      his mind.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>
      <font color="paleturquoise">“I quite
        agree—in regard to Griffin’s ghost, or whatever it was—that its
        appearing first to the little boy, at so tender an age, adds a
        particular <font color="teal">touch.</font> But it’s not the
        first occurrence of its charming kind that I know to have involved a
        child. If the child gives the effect another turn of the screw, what do
        you say to <em>two</em> children—?”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup>“We
      say, of course,” somebody exclaimed, <font color="SaddleBrown">“that they give two
        turns! Also that we want to hear about them.”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="4"><sup>¶4</sup>I can see Douglas there <font color="maroon">before the fire,</font> to which he had got up to present his back,
      looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in his pockets. <font color="paleturquoise">“Nobody but me,
        till now, has ever heard. It’s quite too horrible.”</font> This,
      naturally, was declared by several voices to give the thing the utmost
      price, and our friend, with quiet art, prepared his triumph by <font color="magenta">turning his eyes over</font> the rest of us and
      going on: <font color="paleturquoise">“It’s
        beyond everything. Nothing at all that I know <font color="teal">touches</font> it.”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="5"><sup>¶5</sup>
      <font color="BlueViolet">“For sheer terror?”</font>
      I remember asking.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="6"><sup>¶6</sup>He seemed to say it was not so simple as that; to be really at a loss how to
      qualify it. <font color="teal">He passed his hand over his
        eyes,</font> made a little wincing grimace. <font color="paleturquoise">“For
        dreadful—dreadfulness!”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="7"><sup>¶7</sup>
      <font color="SaddleBrown">
        <font color="darkgreen">“Oh, how delicious!”</font>
      </font> cried one
      of the women.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="8"><sup>¶8</sup>He took no notice of her; he <font color="magenta">looked at me,</font>
      but as if, instead of me, <font color="magenta">he saw what he spoke
        of.</font>
      <font color="paleturquoise">“For general uncanny
        ugliness and horror and pain.”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="9"><sup>¶9</sup>
      <font color="BlueViolet">“Well then,”</font> I
      said, <font color="BlueViolet">“just sit right

        manuscript</font>
      <font color="lightpink">that reached him on <font color="GreenYellow">the third of these

      </font> and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, <font color="lime">he began to read to our hushed little circle
        <font color="GreenYellow">
          <font color="Olive">on the night of the fourth</font>

      </font>
      <font color="mistyrose">The departing ladies who had said they would stay
        didn’t, of course, thank heaven, stay:</font> they departed, in
      consequence of arrangements made, in a rage of curiosity, as they professed,
      produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up. But that
      only made <font color="sienna">his little final auditory</font> more
      compact and select, kept it, <font color="maroon">round the hearth,</font> subject
      to a common thrill.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="38"><sup>¶38</sup>The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the
      tale at a point after it had, in a manner, begun. The fact to be in
      possession of was therefore that his old friend, the youngest of several
      daughters of a poor country parson, had, at the age of twenty, on taking
      service for the first time in the schoolroom, come up to HampshireLondon, in trepidation, to answer in person an advertisement
      that had already placed her in brief correspondence with the advertiser.
      This person proved, on her presenting herself, for judgment, at a house in Harley Street, that impressed her as vast and imposing—this prospective
      patron proved a gentleman, a bachelor in the prime of life, such a figure as
      had never risen, save in a dream <font color="lime">or an old
        novel,</font> before a fluttered, anxious girl out of a Hampshire vicarage. One could easily fix his type; it never, happily,
      dies out. He was handsome and bold and pleasant, off-hand and gay and kind.
      He struck her, inevitably, as gallant and splendid, but what took her most
      of all and gave her the courage she afterward showed was that he put the
      whole thing to her as a kind of favor, an obligation he should gratefully
      incur. She conceived him as rich, but as fearfully extravagant—saw him all
      in a glow of high fashion, of good looks, of expensive habits, of charming
      ways with women. He had for his own town residence a big house filled with
      the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase; but it was to his
      country home, an old family place in Essex, that he wished her immediately to proceed. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="39"><sup>¶39</sup>He had been left, by the death of their parents in India, guardian to a small nephew and a small niece, children of a
      younger, a military brother, whom he had lost <font color="GreenYellow">two years before</font>.
      These children were, by the strangest of chances for a man in his position—a
      lone man without the right sort of experience or a grain of patience—<font color="teal">very heavily on his hands.</font> It had all been
      a great worry and, on his own part doubtless, a series of blunders, but he
      immensely pitied the poor chicks and had done all he could; had in
      particular sent them down to his other house, the proper place for them
      being of course the country, and kept them there, from the first, with the
      best people he could find to look after them, parting even with his own
      servants to wait on them and going down himself, whenever he might, <font color="magenta">to see how they were doing.</font> The awkward
      thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own
      affairs took up all his time. He had put them in possession of Bly, which was healthy and secure, and had placed at the head of
      their little establishment—but below stairs only—an excellent woman,
      Mrs. Grose, whom he was sure his
      visitor would like and who had formerly been maid to his mother. She was now
      housekeeper and was also acting for the time as superintendent to the little
      girl, of whom, without children of her own, she was, by good luck, extremely
      fond. There were plenty of people to help, but of course the young lady who
      should go down as governess would be
      in supreme authority. She would also have, in <font color="GreenYellow">holidays</font>, to look
      after the small boy, who had been for a term at school—young as he was to be
      sent, but what else could be done?—and who, as the holidays were about to
      begin, would be back from one day to the other. There had been for the two
      children at first a young lady whom they had had the misfortune to lose. She
      had done for them quite beautifully—she was a most respectable person—till
      her death, the great awkwardness of which had, precisely, left no
      alternative but the school for little Miles. Mrs. Grose, since
      then, in the way of manners and things, had done as she could for Flora; and there were, further, a cook, a
      housemaid, a dairywoman, an old pony, an old groom, and an old gardener, all
      likewise thoroughly respectable. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="40"><sup>¶40</sup>So far had Douglas presented his picture
      when someone put a question.</div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="41"><sup>¶41</sup>
      <font color="SaddleBrown">“And what did the
        former governess die of?—of so

        learn, and she did learn. You shall hear tomorrow what she learned.
        Meanwhile, of course, the prospect struck her as slightly grim. She was
        young, untried, nervous: it was a <font color="magenta">vision of
          serious duties and little company, of really great loneliness.</font>
        She hesitated—took a couple of days to consult and consider. But the
        salary offered much exceeded her modest measure, and on a second
        interview she faced the music, she engaged.”</font>
      <font color="lightpink">And Douglas, with this,
        made a pause that, for the benefit of the company, moved me to throw

      <font color="BlueViolet">“Oh, <em>I</em> have!”</font> I said. But Douglas, without heeding me, <font color="lime">had begun to read</font>

    <h3>Chapter: 1</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>I remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops, a little
      seesaw of the right throbs and the wrong. After rising, in town, to meet his
      appeal, I had at all events a couple of <font color="GreenYellow">very bad days</font>—found
      myself doubtful again, felt indeed sure I had made a mistake. In this state
      of mind I spent <font color="Olive">the long hours</font> of bumping, swinging coach that
      carried me to the stopping place at which I was to be met by a vehicle from
      the house. This convenience, I was told, had been ordered, and I found, <font color="lightpink">toward the close of the <font color="Olive">June</font>
        <font color="Olive">afternoon</font>, a commodious fly in waiting for me. Driving at
        that hour, on a lovely day, through a country to which the <font color="Olive">summer</font> sweetness
      </font> seemed to offer me a
      friendly welcome, my fortitude mounted afresh and, as we turned into the
      avenue, encountered a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the point to
      which it had sunk. I suppose I had expected, or had dreaded, something so
      melancholy that what greeted me was a good surprise. I remember as a most
      pleasant impression the broad, clear front, its open windows and fresh
      curtains and the pair of maids looking out; I remember the lawn and the
      bright flowers and the crunch of my wheels on the gravel and the clustered
      treetops over which the rooks circled and cawed in the <font color="gold">golden</font> sky. The scene had a greatness that
      made it a different affair from my own scant home, and there immediately
      appeared at the door, with a little girl in her hand, a civil person who
      dropped me as decent a curtsy as if I had been the mistress or a
      distinguished visitor. I had received in Harley Street a narrower notion of the place, and that, as I recalled it,
      made me think the proprietor still more of a gentleman, suggested that what
      I was to enjoy might be something beyond his promise. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>I had no drop again till <font color="Olive">the next day</font>, for I was carried
      triumphantly through <font color="Olive">the following hours</font> by my introduction to
      the younger of my pupils. The little girl who accompanied Mrs. Grose<font color="magenta">appeared to me on the spot a creature so charming
        as to make it a great fortune to have to do with her. She was the most
        beautiful child I had ever seen,</font> and I afterward wondered that my
      employer had not told me more of her. I slept little that night—I was too
      much excited; and this astonished me, too, I recollect, remained with me,
      adding to my sense of the liberality with which I was treated. The large,
      impressive room, one of the best in the house, the great state bed, <font color="teal">as I almost felt it,</font> the full, figured
      draperies, the long glasses in which, for the first time, <font color="magenta">I could see myself from head to foot,</font> all
      struck me—like the extraordinary charm of my small charge—as so many things
      thrown in. It was thrown in as well, from the first moment, that I should
      get on with Mrs. Grose in a relation
      over which, on my way, in the coach, I fear I had rather brooded. The only
      thing indeed that in this early outlook might have made me shrink again was
      the clear circumstance <font color="magenta">of her being so glad to
        see me. I perceived within <font color="Olive">half an hour</font> that she was so
        glad—stout, simple, plain, clean, wholesome woman—as to be positively on
        her guard against showing it too much. I wondered even then a little why
        she should wish not to show it, and that, with reflection, with
        suspicion, might of course have made me uneasy.</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup> But it was a comfort that there could be no uneasiness in a connection with
      anything so beatific as <font color="magenta">the radiant image of my
        little girl, the vision of whose angelic beauty</font> had probably more
      than anything else to do with the restlessness that, before morning, made me
      several times rise and wander about my room to take in the whole picture and
      prospect; <font color="magenta">to watch, from my open window, the faint <font color="Olive">summer</font> dawn, to look at such portions of the
        rest of the house as I could catch,</font> and <font color="sienna">to
        listen, while, in the fading dusk, the first birds began to twitter, for
        the possible recurrence of a sound or two, less natural and not without,
        but within, that I had fancied I heard.</font>
      <font color="sienna">There had been a moment when I believed I recognized, faint
        and far, the cry of a child; </font> there had been another when I found
      myself just consciously starting as at the passage, before my door, of a
      light footstep. <font color="magenta">But these fancies were not marked enough
        not to be thrown off, and it is only in the light, or the gloom, I
        should rather say, of other and subsequent matters that they now come
        back to me. </font>
      <font color="magenta">To watch,</font> teach, “form” little Flora would too evidently be the making of a
      happy and useful life. It had been agreed between us downstairs that after
      this first occasion I should have her as a matter of course at
      <font color="Olive">night</font>, her small white bed
      being already arranged, to that end, in my room. What I had undertaken was
      the whole care of her, and she had remained, just this last time, with
      Mrs. Grose only as an effect of our
      consideration for my inevitable strangeness and her natural timidity. In
      spite of this timidity—which the child herself, in the oddest way in the
      world, had been perfectly frank and brave about, allowing it, without a sign
      of uncomfortable consciousness, with the deep, sweet serenity indeed of one
      of Raphael’s holy infants, to be discussed, to be imputed to her, and to
      determine us—I feel quite sure she would presently like me. It was part of
      what I already liked Mrs. Grose herself
      for, the pleasure I could see her feel in my admiration and wonder as I sat
      at supper with four tall candles and with my pupil, in a high chair and a
      bib, brightly facing me, between them, over bread and milk. There were
      naturally things that in Flora’s presence
      could pass between us only as prodigious and gratified looks, obscure and
      roundabout allusions.

      with a plate in her hand, <font color="magenta">beaming</font> at our companion,

        under care of the guard, and is to be met by the same carriage.” </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="14"><sup>¶14</sup>I forthwith expressed that the proper as well as the pleasant and friendly
      thing would be therefore that on the arrival of the public conveyance I
      should be in waiting for him with his little sister; an idea in which
      Mrs. Grose concurred so heartily that I somehow
      took her manner as a kind of comforting pledge—never falsified, thank
      heaven!—that we should on every question be quite at one. Oh, she was glad I
      was there! </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="15"><sup>¶15</sup>What I felt <font color="GreenYellow">the next day</font> was, I suppose, nothing that could be
      fairly called a reaction from the cheer of my arrival; it was probably at
      the most only a slight oppression produced by a fuller measure of the scale,
      as I walked round them, <font color="magenta">gazed up at them</font>,
      took them in, of my new circumstances. They had, as it were, an extent and
      mass for which I had not been prepared and in the presence of which I found
      myself, freshly, a little scared as well as a little proud. <font color="lightpink">Lessons, in this agitation, certainly suffered some delay;</font> I
      reflected that my first duty was, by the gentlest arts I could contrive, to
      win the child into the sense of knowing me. I spent the day with her
      out-of-doors; I arranged with her, to her great satisfaction, that it should
      be she, she only, who might show me the place. She showed it step by step
      and room by room and secret by secret, with droll, delightful, childish talk
      about it and with the result, in <font color="Olive">half an hour</font>, of our becoming
      immense friends. Young as she was, I was struck, throughout our little tour,
      with her confidence and courage with the way, in empty chambers and dull
      corridors, on crooked staircases that made me pause and even on the summit
      of an old machicolated square tower that made me dizzy, her
      <font color="Olive">morning</font> music, her disposition to tell me so many more
      things than she asked, rang out and led me on. I have not seen Bly since <font color="GreenYellow">the day</font> I left it, <font color="magenta">and I daresay that to my older and more informed
        eyes </font> it would now appear sufficiently contracted. But as my
      little conductress, with her hair of <font color="gold">gold</font> and
      her frock of <font color="azure">blue</font>, danced before me round
      corners and pattered down passages, <font color="lime">I had
        the view of a castle of romance inhabited by a rosy sprite, such a place
        as would somehow, for diversion of the young idea, take all color out of
        storybooks and fairytales. Wasn’t it just a storybook over which I had
        fallen adoze and a dream? </font> No; it was a big, ugly, antique, but
      convenient house, embodying a few features of a building still older,
      half-replaced and half-utilized, in which I had the fancy of our being
      almost as lost as a handful of passengers in a great drifting ship. Well, I
      was, strangely, at the helm!

  <div class="chapter" n="2">
    <h3>Chapter: 2</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>This came home to me when, <font color="GreenYellow">two days later</font>, I drove over with
      Flora to meet, as Mrs. Grose said, the little gentleman; and all
      the more for an incident that, presenting itself <font color="GreenYellow">
        <font color="Olive">the second
          evening</font>
      </font>, had deeply disconcerted me. <font color="GreenYellow">The first
        day</font> had been, on the whole, as I have expressed, reassuring; but
      I was to see it wind up in keen apprehension. <font color="bisque">The
        postbag, that <font color="Olive">evening</font>—it came late—contained a letter for
        me, which, however, in the hand of my employer, I found to be composed
        but of a few words enclosing another, addressed to himself, with a seal
        still unbroken. </font>
      <font color="blueviolet">“This, I recognize, is from the headmaster, and the headmaster’s
        an awful bore. Read him, please; deal with him; but mind you don’t
        report. Not a word. I’m off!” </font> I broke the seal with a great effort—so great a one that I was a long
      time coming to it; took the unopened missive at last up to my room and only
      attacked it just before going to bed. I had better have let it wait till
      <font color="Olive">morning</font>, for it gave me <font color="Olive">a second sleepless
        night</font>. With no counsel to take, <font color="GreenYellow">the next day</font>, I was
      full of distress; and it finally got so the better of me that <font color="lime">I determined to open myself at least to
        Mrs. Grose. </font>

      <font color="magenta">She gave me a look that I remarked at the moment

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="4"><sup>¶4</sup>
      <font color="Indigo">“Sent home—yes. But

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="5"><sup>¶5</sup>Consciously, under my attention, she reddened. <font color="Periwinkle">“They won’t take him?”</font>

    <div class="paragraph" n="6"><sup>¶6</sup>

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="8"><sup>¶8</sup>I hesitated; <font color="bisque">then I judged best simply to hand her my

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="9"><sup>¶9</sup>
      <font color="lime">My counselor couldn’t read!</font> I winced at my mistake,

      <font color="Indigo">“Is he really <em>bad</em>?” </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="10"><sup>¶10</sup>The tears were still in her eyes. <font color="Periwinkle">“Do the gentlemen say so?”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="11"><sup>¶11</sup>
      <font color="Indigo">“They go into no
        particulars. They simply express their regret that it should be
        impossible to keep him. That can have only one meaning.” </font>Mrs. Grose listened with dumb emotion; she forbore to
      ask me what this meaning might be; so that, presently, to put the thing with
      some coherence and with the mere aid of her presence to my own mind, I went
      on: <font color="Indigo">“That he’s an
        injury to the others.”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="12"><sup>¶12</sup>At this, with one of the quick turns of simple folk, she suddenly <font color="maroon">flamed up</font>. <font color="Periwinkle">“Master Miles! <em>him</em> an injury?” </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="13"><sup>¶13</sup>There was such a flood of good faith in it that, though I had not yet seen
      the child, my very fears made me jump to the absurdity of the idea. I found
      myself, to meet my friend the better, offering it, on the spot,
      sarcastically. <font color="Indigo">“To his
        poor little innocent mates!”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="14"><sup>¶14</sup>
      <font color="Periwinkle">“It’s too

    <div class="paragraph" n="15"><sup>¶15</sup>

      <font color="magenta">I felt forthwith a new impatience to see him;</font> it was
      the beginning of a curiosity that, <font color="Olive">for all the next hours</font>, was
      to deepen almost to pain. Mrs. Grose was
      aware, I could judge, of what she had produced in me, and she followed it up
      with assurance.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="17"><sup>¶17</sup>
      <font color="Periwinkle">“You might as well
        believe it of the little lady. Bless her,” </font> she added the next

    <div class="paragraph" n="18"><sup>¶18</sup>I turned and <font color="magenta">saw that Flora, whom, <font color="Olive">ten minutes before</font>, I had
        established in the schoolroom with a sheet of white paper, a pencil, and a copy of nice “round O’s,” now
        presented herself to view at the open door. </font> She expressed in her
      little way an extraordinary detachment from disagreeable duties, looking to
      me, however, with a great childish light that seemed to offer it as a mere
      result of the affection she had conceived for my person, which had rendered
      necessary that she should follow me. I needed nothing more than this to feel
      the full force of Mrs. Grose’s
      comparison, and, <font color="teal">catching my pupil in my arms,
        covered her with kisses in which there was a sob of atonement. </font>

      we went down together, and at the bottom I detained her, holding her there with a hand on her arm.<font color="Indigo">“I take what you said
        to me <font color="Olive">at noon</font> as a declaration that <em>you’ve</em> never known him to be bad.” </font> She threw back
      her head; she had clearly, by this time, and very honestly, adopted an
      attitude. <font color="Periwinkle">“Oh, never

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="25"><sup>¶25</sup>Then, keeping pace with her answer, <font color="Indigo">“So do I!” </font> I eagerly brought out. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="26"><sup>¶26</sup>

      with such a fine bold humor that, with a laugh, a little silly doubtless, to
      match her own, I gave way for the time to the apprehension of ridicule.

    <div class="paragraph" n="30"><sup>¶30</sup>But <font color="GreenYellow">the next day</font>, as <font color="Olive">the hour</font> for my drive

    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>Her thus turning her back on me was fortunately not, for my just
      preoccupations, a snub that could check the growth of our mutual esteem. We
      met, after I had brought home little Miles,
      more intimately than ever on the ground of my stupefaction, my general
      emotion: so monstrous was I then ready to pronounce it that such a child as
      had now been revealed to me should be under an interdict. I was a little
      late on the scene, and I felt, <font color="magenta">as he stood
        wistfully looking out for me before the door of the inn at which the
        coach had put him down, that I had seen him, on the instant, without and
        within, in the great glow of freshness, the same positive fragrance of
        purity, in which I had, from the first moment, seen his little sister.
      </font> He was incredibly beautiful, and Mrs.
      Grose had put her finger on it: everything but a sort of
      passion of tenderness for him was swept away by his presence. <font color="teal">What I then and there took him to my heart for
      </font> was something divine that I have never found to the same degree in
      any child—his indescribable little air of knowing nothing in the world but
      love. It would have been impossible to carry a bad name with a greater
      sweetness of innocence, and by the time I had got back to Bly with him I remained merely bewildered—so far, that is, as I was
      not outraged—by the sense of the <font color="bisque">horrible letter locked
        up in my room, in a drawer. </font> As soon as I could compass a private

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="14"><sup>¶14</sup>This, at all events, was for the time: a time so full that, as I recall the
      way it went, it reminds me of all the art I now need to make it a little
      distinct. What I look back at with amazement is the situation I accepted. I
      had undertaken, with my companion, to see it out, and I was under a charm,
      apparently, that could smooth away the extent and the far and difficult
      connections of such an effort. I was lifted aloft ona great wave of
      infatuation and pity. I found it simple, in my ignorance, my confusion, and
      perhaps my conceit, to assume that I could deal with a boy whose education
      for the world was all on the point of beginning. I am unable even to
      remember at <font color="Olive">this day</font> what proposal I framed for the end of his
      holidays and the resumption of his studies. Lessons with me, indeed, that
      charming <font color="GreenYellow">summer</font>, we all had a theory that he was
      to have; but I now feel that, <font color="Olive">for weeks</font>, the lessons must have
      been rather my own. I learned something—at first, certainly—that hadn ot
      been one of the teachings of my small, smothered life; learned tobe amused,
      and even amusing, and not to think for the morrow. It was the first time, in
      a manner, that I had known space and air and freedom, all the music of
      summer and all the mystery of nature. And then there was consideration—and
      consideration was sweet. Oh, it was a trap—not designed, but deep—to my
      imagination, to my delicacy, perhaps to my vanity; to whatever, in me, was
      most excitable. The best way to picture it all is to say that I was off my
      guard. They gave me so little trouble—they were of a gentleness so
      extraordinary. <font color="teal">I used to speculate—but even this
        with a dim disconnectedness—as to how the rough future (for all futures
        are rough!) would handle them and might bruise them. </font> They had the
      bloom of health and happiness; and yet, as if I had been in charge of a pair
      of little grandees, of princes of the blood, for whom everything, to be
      right, would have to be enclosed and protected, the only form that, in my
      fancy, the after years could take for them was that of a romantic, a really
      royal extension of the garden and the park. It may be, of course, above all,
      that what suddenly broke into this gives the previous time a charm of
      stillness—that hush in which something gathers or crouches. The change was
      actually like the spring of a beast. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="15"><sup>¶15</sup>In the <font color="Olive">first weeks</font> the days were long; they often, at their
      finest,gave me what I used to call my own hour, the hour when, for my
      pupils, teatime and bedtime having come and gone, I had, before my final
      retirement, a small interval alone. Much as I liked my companions,
      <font color="Olive">this hour</font> was the thing in <font color="Olive">the day</font> I liked
      most; and I liked it best of all when, as the light faded—or rather, I
      should say, the day lingered and the last calls of the last birds sounded,
      in a flushed sky, from the old trees—I could take a turn into the grounds
      and enjoy, almost with a sense of property that amused and flattered me, the
      beauty and dignity of the place. It was a pleasure at these moments to feel
      myself tranquil and justified; doubtless, perhaps, also to reflect that by
      my discretion, my quiet good sense and general high propriety, I was giving
      pleasure—if he ever thought of it!—to the person to whose pressure I had
      responded. What I was doing was what he had earnestly hoped and directly
      asked of me, and that I <em>could</em>, after all, do it
      proved even a greater joy than I had expected. I daresay I fancied myself,
      in short, a remarkable young woman and took comfort in the faith that this
      would more publicly appear. Well, I needed to be remarkable to offer a front
      to the remarkable things that presently gave their first sign.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="16"><sup>¶16</sup>It was plump, <font color="Olive">one afternoon</font>, in the middle of my very hour: the
      children were tucked away, and I had come out for my stroll. One of the
      thoughts that, as I don’t in the least shrink now from noting, used to be
      with me in these wanderings <font color="lime">was that it
        would be as charming as a charming story suddenly to meet someone.
        Someone would appear there at the turn of a path and would stand before
        me and smile and approve. </font> I didn’t ask more than that—I only
      asked that he should <em>know;</em> and the only way to
      be sure he knew would be to see it, and the kind light of it, in his
      handsome face. That was exactly present to me—by which I mean the face
      was—when, on the first of these occasions, at the end of a long <font color="GreenYellow">June</font> day, I stopped short on emerging from one of the
      plantations and coming into view of the house. What arrested me on the
      spot—<font color="magenta">and with a shock much greater than any
        vision had allowed for</font>—was the sense that <font color="magenta">my imagination had, in a flash, turned real.
      </font> He did stand there!—but high up, beyond the lawn and at the very top
      of the tower to which, on that <font color="Olive">first morning</font>, little Flora had conducted me. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="17"><sup>¶17</sup>This tower was one of a pair—square, incongruous, crenelated structures—that
      were distinguished, for some reason, though I could see little difference,
      as the new and the old. They flanked opposite ends of the house and were
      probably architectural absurdities, redeemed in a measure indeed by not
      being wholly disengaged nor of a height too pretentious, dating, in their
      gingerbread antiquity, <font color="lime">from a romantic
        revival that was already a respectable past. </font> I admired them, had
      fancies about them, for we could all profit in a degree, especially when
      they loomed through the dusk, by the grandeur of their actual battlements;
      yet it was not at such an elevation that the figure I had so often invoked
      seemed most in place. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="18"><sup>¶18</sup>It produced in me, this figure, in the clear twilight, I remember, two
      distinct gasps of emotion, which were, sharply, the shock of my first and
      that of my second surprise. My second was a violent perception of the
      mistake of my first: the man who met my eyes was not the person I had
      precipitately supposed. <font color="magenta">There came to me thus a
        bewilderment of vision of which, <font color="GreenYellow">after these years</font>, there
        is no living view that I can hope to give. </font> An unknown man in a
      lonely place is a permitted object of fear to a young woman privately bred;
      and the figure that faced me was—<font color="Olive">a few more seconds</font> assured
      me—as little anyone else I knew as it was the image that had been in my
      mind. I had not seen it in Harley Street—I had not seen it anywhere. The place, moreover, in the
      strangest way in the world, had, on the instant, and by the very fact of its
      appearance, become a solitude. To me at least, making my statement here with
      a deliberation with which I have never made it, the whole feeling of the
      moment returns. It was as if, while I took in—what I did take in—all the
      rest of the scene had been stricken with death. <font color="sienna">I
        can hear again, as I write, the intense hush in which the sounds of
        <font color="Olive">evening</font> dropped. The rooks stopped cawing in the <font color="gold">golden</font> sky, and <font color="Olive">the friendly
          hour</font> lost, for the minute, all its voice.
      </font> But there
      was no other change in nature, unless indeed it were a change that I saw
      with a stranger sharpness. The <font color="gold">gold</font> was still
      in the sky, the clearness in the air, and the man who looked at me over the
      battlements was <font color="magenta">as definite as a picture in a
        frame. </font> That’s how I thought, with extraordinary quickness, of
      each person that he might have been and that he was not. We were confronted
      across our distance quite long enough for me to ask myself with intensity
      who then he was and to feel, as an effect of my inability to say, a wonder
      that in a few instants more became intense.</div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="19"><sup>¶19</sup>The great question, or one of these, is, afterward, I know, with regard to
      certain matters, the question of how long they have lasted. Well, this
      matter of mine, think what you will of it, <font color="teal">lasted while I caught at a dozen possibilities,</font> none of which
      made a difference for the better, that I could see, in there having been in
      the house—and for how long, above all?—a person of whom I was in ignorance.
      It lasted while I just bridled a little with the sense that my office
      demanded that there should be no such ignorance and no such person. It
      lasted while this visitant, at all events—and there was <font color="teal">a touch of the strange freedom, </font> as I
      remember, in the sign of familiarity of his wearing no hat—<font color="magenta">
        <font color="teal">seemed to fix
          me,</font>
      </font> from his position, with just the question, just the
      scrutiny through the fading light, that his own presence provoked. <font color="sienna">
        <font color="sienna">
          <font color="magenta">We were too far apart to call to each
            other, but there was a moment at which, at shorter range, some
            challenge between us, breaking the hush, would have been the
            right result of our straight mutual stare.</font>
        </font>
      </font> He
      was in one of the angles, the one away from the house, very erect, as it
      struck me, and with both hands on the ledge. <font color="magenta">So I
        saw him as I see the letters I form on this page;</font> then, exactly,
      <font color="Olive">after a minute</font>, as if to add to the spectacle, he slowly
      changed his place—passed, <font color="magenta">looking at me hard all
        the while, </font> to the opposite corner of the platform. Yes, I had the
      sharpest sense that during this transit <font color="magenta">he never
        took his eyes from me, and I can see at this moment <font color="teal">the way his hand, as he went, passed from one
          of the crenelations to the next. </font>
      </font> He stopped at the other corner, but less long, and even as he turned
      away still markedly <font color="magenta">fixed me.</font> He turned
      away; that was all I knew.

    <h3>Chapter: 4</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>It was not that I didn’t wait, on this occasion, for more, for I was rooted
      as deeply as I was shaken. Was there a “secret” at Bly— <font color="lime">Ann Radcliffe<em>The Mystery of Udolpho</em> a mystery of Udolpho or Charlotte Bronte <em>Jane Eyre</em> an insane, an unmentionable relative kept in unsuspected
        confinement? </font> I can’t say how long I turned it over, or how long, in a confusion of
      curiosity and dread, I remained where I had had my collision; I only recall
      that when I re-entered the house darkness had quite closed in. Agitation, in
      the interval, certainly had held me and driven me, for I must, in circling
      about the place, have walked three miles; but I was to be, later on, so much
      more overwhelmed that this mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human
      chill. The most singular part of it, in fact—singular as the rest had
      been—was the part I became, in the hall, aware of in meeting Mrs. Grose. <font color="magenta">This
        picture comes back to me </font> in the general train—the impression, as
      I received it on my return, of the wide white
      panelled space, bright in the lamplight and with its portraits and <font color="red">red</font> carpet, and of the good surprised look of my
      friend, which immediately told me she had missed me. It came to me
      straightway, <font color="teal">under her contact,</font> that, with
      plain heartiness, mere relieved anxiety at my appearance, she knew nothing
      whatever that could bear upon the incident I had there ready for her. <font color="magenta">I had not suspected in advance that <font color="teal">her comfortable face would pull me up, </font>
      </font> and I somehow measured the importance of what I had seen by my thus
      finding myself <font color="lightpink">hesitate to mention it</font>. Scarce
      anything in the whole history seems to me so odd as this fact that my real
      beginning of fear was one, as I may say, with the instinct of sparing my
      companion. On the spot, accordingly, in the pleasant hall <font color="magenta">and with her eyes on me, </font> I, for a reason
      that I couldn’t then have phrased, achieved an inward resolution—offered a
      vague pretext for my lateness and, with the plea of the beauty of the night
      and of the heavy dew and wet feet, went as soon as possible to my room. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>Here it was another affair; here, <font color="GreenYellow">for many days after</font>, it was a
      queer affair enough. There were hours, from day to day—or at least there
      were moments, snatched even from clear duties—when I had to shut myself up
      to think. It was not so much yet that I was more nervous than I could bear
      to be as that I was remarkably afraid of becoming so; for the truth I had
      now to turn over was, simply and clearly, the truth that I could arrive at
      no account whatever of the visitor with whom I had been so inexplicably and
      yet, as it seemed to me, so intimately concerned. It took little time to see
      that I could sound without forms of inquiry and without exciting remark any
      domestic complications. The shock I had suffered must have sharpened all my
      senses; I felt sure, <font color="GreenYellow">at the end of three days</font> and as the result
      of mere closer attention, that I had not been practiced upon by the servants
      nor made the object of any “game.” Of whatever it was that I knew, nothing
      was known around me. There was but one sane inference: someone had taken a
      liberty rather gross. That was what, repeatedly, I dipped into my room and
      locked the door to say to myself. We had been, collectively, subject to an
      intrusion; some unscrupulous traveler, curious in old houses, had made his
      way in unobserved, enjoyed the prospect from the best point of view, and
      then stolen out as he came. <font color="magenta">If he had given me
        such a bold hard stare, that was but a part of his indiscretion. The
        good thing, after all, was that we should surely see no more of him.
      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup> This was not so good a thing, I admit, as not to leave me to judge that
      what, essentially, made nothing else much signify was simply my charming
      work. My charming work was just my life with Miles and Flora, and
      through nothing could I so like it as through feeling that I could throw
      myself into it in trouble. The attraction of my small charges was a constant
      joy, leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my original fears, the
      distaste I had begun by entertaining for the probable gray prose of my
      office. There was to be no gray prose, it appeared, and no long grind; so
      how could work not be charming that presented itself as <font color="GreenYellow">daily</font>
      beauty? It was all the <font color="lime">romance of the
        nursery and the poetry of the schoolroom. </font> I don’t mean by this,
      of course, that we studied only fiction and verse; I mean I can express no
      otherwise the sort of interest my companions inspired. How can I describe
      that except by saying that instead of growing used to them—and it’s a marvel
      for a governess: I call the
      sisterhood to witness!—I made constant fresh discoveries. There was one
      direction, assuredly, in which these discoveries stopped: deep obscurity
      continued to cover the region of the boy’s conduct at school. It had been
      promptly given me, I have noted, to face that mystery without a pang.
      Perhaps even it would be nearer the truth to say that—without a word—he
      himself had cleared it up. He had made the whole charge absurd. My
      conclusion bloomed there with the real <font color="darkmagenta">rose</font>
      flush of his innocence: he was only too fine and fair for the little horrid,
      unclean school-world, and he had paid a price for it. I reflected acutely
      that the sense of such differences, such superiorities of quality, always,
      on the part of the majority—which could include even stupid, sordid
      headmasters—turn infallibly to the vindictive. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="4"><sup>¶4</sup>Both the children had a gentleness (it was their only fault, and it never
      made Miles a muff) that kept them—how shall
      I express it?—almost impersonal and certainly quite unpunishable. They were
      like the cherubs of the anecdote, who had—morally, at any rate—nothing to
      whack! I remember feeling with Miles in
      especial as if he had had, as it were, no history. We expect of a small
      child a scant one, but there was in this beautiful little boy something
      extraordinarily sensitive, yet extraordinarily happy, that, more than in any
      creature of his age I have seen, struck me as beginning anew <font color="GreenYellow">each
        day</font>. He had never <font color="Olive">for a second</font> suffered. I took this
      as a direct disproof of his having really been chastised. If he had been
      wicked he would have <font color="mistyrose"> “caught” it, and I should have
        caught it by the rebound</font>—I should have found the trace. I found
      nothing at all, and he was therefore an angel. He never spoke of his school,
      never mentioned a comrade or a master; and I, for my part, was quite too
      much disgusted to allude to them. Of course I was under the spell, and the
      wonderful part is that, even at the time, I perfectly knew I was. But I gave
      myself up to it; it was an antidote to any pain, and I had more pains than
      one. <font color="bisque">I was in receipt in <font color="GreenYellow">these days</font> of
        disturbing letters from home, </font> where things were not going well.
      But with my children, what things in the world mattered? That was the
      question I used to put to my scrappy retirements. I was dazzled by their
      loveliness. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="5"><sup>¶5</sup>There was <font color="GreenYellow">a Sunday</font>—to get on—when it rained with such force and
      for so many hours that there could be no procession to church; in
      consequence of which, as <font color="GreenYellow">the day</font> declined, I had arranged with
      Mrs. Grose that, should <font color="Olive">the
        evening</font> show improvement, we would attend together the late
      service. The rain happily stopped, and I prepared for our walk, which,
      through the park and by the good road to the village, would be a matter of
      <font color="Olive">twenty minutes</font>. Coming downstairs to meet my colleague in
      the hall, I remembered a pair of gloves that had required three stitches and
      that had received them—with a publicity perhaps not edifying—while I sat
      with the children at their tea, served on <font color="GreenYellow">Sundays</font>, by
      exception, in that cold, clean temple of mahogany and brass, the “grown-up”
      dining room. The gloves had been dropped there, and I turned in to recover
      them. <font color="GreenYellow">The day</font> was gray enough, but <font color="Olive">the afternoon</font>
      light still lingered, and it enabled me, on crossing the threshold, not only
      to recognize, on a chair near the wide window, then closed, the articles I
      wanted, <font color="magenta">but to become aware of a person on the
        other side of the window and looking straight in. </font>
      <font color="magenta">One step into the room had sufficed; my vision
        was instantaneous; it was all there. </font>
      <font color="magenta">The person looking straight in was the person who had
        already appeared to me. He appeared thus again with I won’t say greater
        distinctness, for that was impossible, but with a nearness that
        represented a forward stride in our intercourse and made me, as I met
        him, catch my breath and turn cold. </font>
      <font color="magenta">He was the same—he was the same, and seen, this
        time, as he had been seen before, from the waist up, the window, though
        the dining room was on the ground floor, not going down to the terrace
        on which he stood. </font>
      <font color="magenta">His face was close to the glass, yet the effect
        of this better view was, strangely, only to show me how intense the
        former had been. He remained but <font color="Olive">a few seconds</font>—long enough
        to convince me he also saw and recognized; but it was as if I had been
        looking at him for <font color="GreenYellow">years</font> and had known him always. </font>
      Something, however, happened this time that had not happened before; <font color="magenta">his stare into my face, through the glass and
        across the room, was as deep and hard as then, but it quitted me for a
        moment during which I could still watch it, see it fix successively
        several other things. </font> On the spot there came to me the added
      shock of a certitude that it was not for me he had come there. He had come
      for someone else.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="6"><sup>¶6</sup>The <font color="magenta">flash</font> of this knowledge—for it was knowledge in
      the midst of dread—produced in me the most extraordinary effect, started as
      I stood there, a sudden vibration of duty and courage. I say courage because
      I was beyond all doubt already far gone. I bounded straight out of the door
      again, reached that of the house, got, in an instant, upon the drive, and,
      passing along the terrace as fast as I could rush, turned a corner and came
      full in sight. But it was in sight of nothing now—my visitor had vanished. I
      stopped, I almost dropped, with the real relief of this; but I took in the
      whole scene—I gave him time to reappear. I call it <font color="Olive">time</font>, but
      how long was it? I can’t speak to the purpose <font color="GreenYellow">today</font> of the
      duration of these things. That kind of measure must have left me: they
      couldn’t have lasted as they actually appeared to me to last. The terrace
      and the whole place, the lawn and the garden beyond it, all I could see of
      the park, were empty with a great emptiness. There were shrubberies and big
      trees, but I remember the clear assurance I felt that none of them concealed
      him. He was there or was not there: not there if I didn’t see him. I got
      hold of this; then, instinctively, instead of returning as I had come, went
      to the window. It was confusedly present to me that I ought to place myself
      where he had stood. I did so; <font color="magenta">I applied my face
        to the pane and looked, as he had looked,</font> into the room. As if, at
      this moment, to show me exactly what his range had been, Mrs. Grose, as I had done for himself just
      before, came in from the hall. <font color="magenta">With this I had
        the full image</font> of a <font color="mistyrose">repetition of what had
        already occurred. </font>
      <font color="magenta">She saw me as I had seen my own visitant;</font>
      she pulled up short as I had done; I gave her something of the shock that I
      had received. She turned white, and this made
      me ask myself if I had blanched as much. <font color="magenta">She
        stared,</font> in short, and retreated on just <em>my
      </em> lines, and I knew she had then passed out and come round to me and
      that I should presently meet her. I remained where I was, and while I waited
      I thought of more things than one. But there’s only one I take space to
      mention. I wondered why <em>she</em> should be scared.

        a good deal. His eyes are sharp, strange—awfully; but I only know
        clearly that they’re rather small and very fixed. His mouth’s wide, and

    <h3>Chapter: 6</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>It took of course more than that particular passage to place us together in
      presence of what we had now to live with as we could—my dreadful liability
      to impressions of the order so vividly exemplified, and my companion’s
      knowledge, henceforth—a knowledge half consternation and half compassion—of
      that liability. There had been, <font color="Olive">this evening</font>, after the
      revelation left me, for <font color="Olive">an hour</font>, so prostrate—there had been,
      for either of us, no attendance on any service but a little service of tears
      and vows, of prayers and promises, a climax to the series of mutual
      challenges and pledges that had straightway ensued on our retreating
      together to the schoolroom and shutting ourselves up there to have
      everything out. The result of our having everything out was simply to reduce
      our situation to the last rigor of its elements. <font color="magenta">She herself had seen nothing, not the shadow of a shadow, and nobody in
        the house but the governess was
        in the governess’s plight; </font>
      yet she accepted without directly impugning my sanity the truth as I gave it
      to her, and ended by showing me, on this ground, an awestricken tenderness,
      an expression of the sense of my more than questionable privilege, of which
      the very breath has remained with me as that of the sweetest of human
      charities. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>What was settled between us, accordingly, that night, was that we thought we
      might bear things together; and I was not even sure that, in spite of her
      exemption, it was she who had the best of the burden. I knew <font color="Olive">at this
        hour</font>, I think, as well as I knew later, what I was capable of
      meeting to shelter my pupils; but it took me some time to be wholly sure of
      what my honest ally was prepared for to keep terms with so compromising a
      contract. I was queer company enough—quite as queer as the company I
      received; but as I trace over what we went through <font color="magenta">I see </font> how much common ground we must have
      found in the one idea that, by good fortune, <em>could
      </em> steady us. It was the idea, the second movement, that led me
      straight out, as I may say, of the inner chamber of my dread. I could take
      the air in the court, at least, and there Mrs.
      Grose could join me. Perfectly can I recall now the
      particular way strength came to me before we separated for the night. <font color="magenta">We had gone over and over every feature of what I

      <font color="Indigo">“Heaven forbid! The

      That he might was an awful conception, and yet, somehow, I could keep it at
      bay; which, moreover, as we lingered there, was what I succeeded in
      practically proving. <font color="magenta">I had an absolute certainty
        that I should see again what I had already seen, </font> but something
      within me said that by offering myself bravely as the sole subject of such
      experience, by accepting, by inviting, by surmounting it all, I should serve
      as an expiatory victim and guard the tranquility of my companions. The
      children, in especial, I should thus fence about and absolutely save. I
      recall one of the last things I said that night to Mrs. Grose.

      colony. But there was everything, for our apprehension, in the lucky fact
      that no discomfortable legend, no perturbation scullions, had ever, within
      anyone’s memory attached to the kind old place. It had neither bad name nor
      ill fame, and Mrs. Grose, most
      apparently, <font color="teal">only desired to cling to me </font>
      and to quake in silence. I even put her, the very last thing of all, to the

      <font color="GreenYellow">

      a failure of frankness, but because on every side there were fears. It seems
      to me indeed, in retrospect, that by the time the morrow’s sun was high I
      had restlessly <font color="lime">read into the fact before us
        almost all the meaning they were to receive from subsequent and
        morecruel occurrences. </font> What they gave me above all was just the
      sinister figure of the living man—the dead one would keep awhile!—and of
      <font color="GreenYellow">the months</font> he had continuously passed at Bly, which, added up, made a formidable stretch. The limit of this
      evil time had arrived only when, on the dawn of a <font color="GreenYellow">winter’s</font>
      <font color="Olive">morning</font>, Peter Quint was
      found, by a laborer going to early work, stone dead on the road from the
      village: a catastrophe explained—superficially at least—by a visible wound
      to his head; such a wound as might have been produced—and as, on the final
      evidence, <em>had </em> been—by a fatal slip, in the dark
      and after leaving the public house, on the steepish icy slope, a wrong path
      altogether, at the bottom of which he lay. The icy slope, the turn mistaken
      at night and in liquor, accounted for much—practically, in the end and after
      the inquest and boundless chatter, for everything; but there had been
      matters in his life—strange passages and perils, secret disorders, vices
      more than suspected—that would have accounted for a good deal more.

      me. <font color="magenta">I now saw that I had been asked for a
        service admirable and difficult; and there would be a greatness in

      protect and defend the little creatures in the world the most bereaved and
      the most lovable, the appeal of whose helplessness had suddenly become only
      too explicit, a deep, constant ache of one’s own committed heart. We were
      cut off, really, together; we were united in our danger. They had nothing
      but me, and I—well, I had <em> them</em>. It was in short
      a magnificent chance. This chance presented itself to me in an image richly

    <div class="paragraph" n="41"><sup>¶41</sup>This moment dated from <font color="Olive">an afternoon hour</font> that I happened to
      spend in the grounds with the younger of my pupils alone. We had left
      Miles indoors, on the <font color="red">red</font> cushion of a deep window seat; <font color="lime">he had wished to finish a book, </font> and I had
      been glad to encourage a purpose so laudable in a young man whose only
      defect was an occasional excess of the restless. His sister, on the
      contrary, had been alert to come out, and I strolled with her <font color="Olive">half an
        hour</font>, seeking the shade, for the sun was still high and the day
      exceptionally warm. I was aware afresh, with her, as we went, of how, like
      her brother, she contrived—it was the charming thing in both children—to let
      me alone without appearing to drop me and to accompany me without appearing
      to surround. They were never importunate and yet never listless. My
      attention to them all really went to seeing them amuse themselves immensely
      without me: this was a spectacle they seemed actively to prepare and that
      engaged me as an active admirer. <font color="salmon">I walked in a
        world of their invention—they had no occasion whatever to draw upon
        mine; so that my time was taken only with being, for them, some
        remarkable person or thing that the game of the moment required and that
        was merely, thanks to my superior, my exalted stamp, a happy and highly
        distinguished sinecure. I forget what I was on the present occasion; I
        only remember that I was something very important and very quiet and
        that Flora was playing very hard. We
        were on the edge of the lake, and, as we had lately begun geography, the
        lake was the Sea of Azof.</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="42"><sup>¶42</sup>Suddenly, in these circumstances, I became aware that, on the other side of
      the Sea of Azof, we had an interested
      spectator. The way this knowledge gathered in me was the strangest thing in
      the world—the strangest, that is, except the very much stranger in which it
      quickly merged itself. I had sat down with a piece of work—for I was
      something or other that could sit—on the old stone bench which overlooked
      the pond; and in this position I began to take in with certitude, and yet
      <font color="magenta">without direct vision</font>, the presence, at a
      distance, of a thin person.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="43"><sup>¶43</sup>The old trees, the thick shrubbery, made a great and pleasant shade, but it
      was all suffused with the brightness of the hot, still hour. There was no
      ambiguity in anything; none whatever, at least, in the conviction I from one
      moment to another found myself forming as to <font color="magenta">what
        I should see straight before me and across the lake as a consequence of
        raising my eyes. </font> They were attached at this juncture to the
      stitching in which I was engaged, and I can feel once more the spasm of my
      effort not to move them till I should so have steadied myself as to be able
      to make up my mind what to do. There was an alien object in view—a figure
      whose right of presence I instantly, passionately questioned. I recollect
      counting over perfectly the possibilities, reminding myself that nothing was
      more natural, for instance, then the appearance of one of the men about the
      place, or even of a messenger, a postman, or a tradesman’s boy, from the
      village. That reminder had as little effect on my practical certitude as I
      was conscious—still even without looking—of its having upon the character
      and attitude of our visitor. Nothing was more natural than that these things
      should be the other things that they absolutely were not. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="44"><sup>¶44</sup>Of the positive identity of the apparition I would assure myself as soon as
      the small clock of my courage should have ticked out the right second;
      meanwhile, with an effort that was already sharp enough, <font color="magenta">I transferred my eyes straight to little Flora,</font> who, at the moment, was about
      ten yards away. My heart had stood still for an instant with the wonder and
      terror of the question <font color="magenta">whether she too would
        see;</font> and I held my breath <font color="sienna">while I waited
        for what a cry from her, what some sudden innocent sign either of
        interest or of alarm, would tell me. </font> I waited, but nothing came;
      then, in the first place—and there is something more dire in this, I feel,
      than in anything I have to relate—I was determined by a sense that,
      <font color="Olive">within a minute</font>, <font color="sienna">all sounds from
        her had previously dropped;</font> and, <font color="Olive">in the second</font>, by
      the circumstance that, also <font color="Olive">within the minute</font>, she had, in her
      play, turned her back to the water.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="45"><sup>¶45</sup>This was her attitude <font color="magenta">when I at last looked at
        her—looked with the confirmed conviction that we were still, together,
        under direct personal notice. </font> She had picked up a small flat
      piece of wood, which happened to have in it a little hole that had evidently
      suggested to her the idea of sticking in another fragment that might figure
      as a mast and make the thing a boat. This second morsel, <font color="magenta">as I watched her,</font> she was very markedly and
      intently attempting to tighten in its place. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="46"><sup>¶46</sup>My apprehension of what she was doing sustained me so that <font color="Olive">after some
        seconds</font> I felt I was ready for more. <font color="magenta">Then I again shifted my eyes—I faced what I had to face.</font>

    <h3>Chapter: 8</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>What I had said to Mrs. Grose was true
      enough: there were in the matter I had put before her depths and
      possibilities that I lacked resolution to sound; so that when we met once
      more in the wonder of it we were of a common mind about the duty of
      resistance to extravagant fancies. We were to keep our heads if we should
      keep nothing else—difficult indeed as that might be in the face of what, in
      our prodigious experience, was least to be questioned. <font color="Olive">Late that
        night</font>, while the house slept, we had another talk in my room,
      <font color="magenta">when she went all the way with me as to its
        being beyond doubt that I had seen exactly what I had seen. </font>
      <font color="teal">To hold her perfectly in the pinch of
        that,</font> I found I had only to ask her how, if I had “made it up,” I
      came to be able to give, of each of the persons appearing to me, a picture
      disclosing, to the last detail, their special marks—a portrait on the
      exhibition of which she had instantly recognized and named them. She wished
      of course—small blame to her!—to sink the whole subject; and I was quick to
      assure her that my own interest in it had now violently taken the form of a
      search for the way to escape from it. <font color="mistyrose">I encountered
        her on the ground of a probability that with recurrence—for recurrence
        we took for granted</font>—I should get used to my danger, distinctly
      professing that my personal exposure had suddenly become the least of my
      discomforts. It was my new suspicion that was intolerable; and yet even to
      this complication <font color="Olive">the later hours of the day</font> had brought a
      little ease.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>On leaving her, after my first outbreak, I had of course returned to my
      pupils, associating the right remedy for my dismay with that sense of their
      charm which I had already found to be a thing I could positively cultivate
      and which had never failed me yet. I had simply, in other words, plunged
      afresh into Flora’s special society and
      there become aware—it was almost a luxury!— <font color="teal">that
        she could put her little conscious hand straight upon the spot that
        ached. </font>
      <font color="magenta">She had looked at me in sweet speculation and
        then had accused me to my face of having “cried.” </font> I had supposed
      I had brushed away the ugly signs: but I could literally—for the time, at
      all events—rejoice, under this fathomless charity, that they had not
      entirely disappeared. <font color="magenta">To gaze into the depths of
        <font color="azure">blue</font> of the child’s eyes
      </font> and
      pronounce their loveliness a trick of premature cunning was to be guilty of
      a cynicism in preference to which I naturally preferred to abjure my
      judgment and, so far as might be, my agitation. I couldn’t abjure for merely
      wanting to, but I could repeat to Mrs.
      Grose—as I did there, over and over, in the small
      <font color="Olive">hours</font>—that with their voices in the air, their pressure on
      one’s heart, and their fragrant faces against one’s cheek, everything fell
      to the ground but their incapacity and their beauty. It was a pity that,
      somehow, to settle this once for all, I had equally to re-enumerate the
      signs of subtlety that, in the afternoon, by the lake had made a miracle of
      my show of self-possession. It was a pity to be obliged to reinvestigate the
      certitude of the moment itself and repeat how it had come to me as a
      revelation that the inconceivable communion I then surprised was a matter,
      for either party, of habit. It was a pity that I should have had to quaver
      out again the reasons for my not having, in my delusion, so much as
      questioned that the little girl <font color="magenta">saw our visitant
        even as I actually saw Mrs. Grose
        herself, and that she wanted, by just so much as she did thus see, to
        make me suppose she didn’t, and at the same time, without showing
        anything, arrive at a guess as to whether I myself did! </font> It was a
      pity that I needed once more to describe the portentous little activity by
      which she sought to divert my attention—the perceptible increase of
      movement, the greater intensity of play, the singing, the gabbling of
      nonsense, and the invitation to romp.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup> Yet if I had not indulged, to prove there was nothing in it, in this review,
      I should have missed the two or three dim elements of comfort that still
      remained to me. I should not for instance have been able to asseverate to my
      friend that I was certain—which was so much to the good—that <em>I</em> at least had not betrayed myself. I should not
      have been prompted, by stress of need, by desperation of mind—I scarce know
      what to call it—to invoke such further aid to intelligence as might spring
      from <font color="teal">pushing my colleague fairly to the wall. </font>
      <font color="teal">She had told me, bit by bit, under pressure, a
        great deal;</font> but a small shifty spot on the wrong side of it all
      still sometimes brushed my brow like the wing of a bat; and I remember how
      on this occasion—for the sleeping house and the concentration alike of our
      danger and our watch seemed to help—I felt the importance of giving the last
      jerk to the curtain. <font color="Indigo">“I
        don’t believe anything so horrible,” </font> I recollect saying; <font color="Indigo">“no, let us put it
        definitely, my dear, that I don’t. But if I did, you know, there’s a
        thing I should require now, just without sparing you the least bit
        more—oh, not a scrap, come!—to get out of you. What was it you had in
        mind when, in our distress, before Miles came back, <font color="bisque">over the letter from
          his school, </font> you said, under my insistence, that you didn’t
        pretend for him that he had not literally <em>ever
        </em> been ‘bad’? He has <em>not</em> literally
        ‘ever,’ in <font color="GreenYellow">these weeks</font> that I myself have lived with him
        and <font color="magenta">so closely watched him;</font> he has been
        an imperturbable little prodigy of delightful, lovable goodness.
        Therefore you might perfectly have made the claim for him if you had
        not, as it happened, <font color="magenta">seen an exception to
          take. </font> What was your exception, and to what passage in <font color="magenta">
          <font color="magenta">your personal
            observation of him did you refer?”</font>
        </font>
      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="4"><sup>¶4</sup>It was a dreadfully austere inquiry, but levity was not our note, and, at any
      rate, before the gray dawn admonished us to separate I had got my answer.
      What my friend had had in mind proved to be immensely to the purpose. It was
      neither more nor less than the circumstance that for a period of
      <font color="GreenYellow">several months</font>Quint and the boy had been perpetually
      together. It was in fact the very appropriate truth that she had ventured to
      criticize the propriety, to hint at the incongruity, of so close an
      alliance, and even to go so far on the subject as a frank overture to
      Miss Jessel. Miss Jessel had, with a most strange manner,
      requested her to mind her business, and the good woman had, on this,
      directly approached little Miles. What she
      had said to him, <font color="teal">since I pressed, </font> was
      that <font color="magenta"><em>she</em></font> liked to see young gentlemen not forget their station.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="5"><sup>¶5</sup>I <font color="teal">pressed</font> again, of course, at this. <font color="Indigo">“You reminded him that

    <div class="paragraph" n="6"><sup>¶6</sup>

    <div class="paragraph" n="8"><sup>¶8</sup>
      <font color="Periwinkle">“No, not that. It’s
        just what he <em>wouldn’t!</em>” </font> she could
      still impress upon me. <font color="Periwinkle">“I was sure, at any rate,” </font> she added, <font color="Periwinkle">“that he didn’t. But he denied certain
        occasions.” </font>

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="11"><sup>¶11</sup>
      <font color="Indigo">“He then prevaricated

      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="12"><sup>¶12</sup>
      <font color="Periwinkle">“Oh!”</font>Mrs. Grose mumbled. This was a suggestion that it
      didn’t matter; which indeed she backed up by a further remark. <font color="Periwinkle">“You see, after all,
        Miss Jessel didn’t mind. She
        didn’t forbid him.” </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="13"><sup>¶13</sup>I considered. <font color="Indigo">“Did he
        put that to you as a justification?” </font>

        impression that, in the past, when you had, without my aid, to flounder
        about in silence, most of all made you miserable. But I shall get it out
        of you yet! There was something in the boy that suggested to you,”

      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="22"><sup>¶22</sup>“Ah, nothing that’s not nice <em>now!</em>” Mrs. Grose lugubriously pleaded. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="23"><sup>¶23</sup>
      <font color="Indigo">“I don’t wonder <font color="magenta">you looked queer,”</font>

      <font color="Periwinkle">
        <font color="magenta">“I doubt if I looked as queer as you!”</font>
      </font> she retorted with homely force.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="25"><sup>¶25</sup>
      <font color="Periwinkle">“And if he was so bad
        then as that comes to, how is he such an angel now?” </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="26"><sup>¶26</sup>
      <font color="Indigo">“Yes, indeed—and if he
        was a fiend at school! <font color="mistyrose">How, how, how? </font>
        Well,” </font> I said in my torment, <font color="Indigo">“ <font color="mistyrose">you must put it to me again,
          but I shall not be able to tell you <font color="GreenYellow">for some days</font>.
          Only, put it to me again!” </font>
      </font>
      <font color="magenta">I cried in a way that made my friend stare.</font>
      <font color="Indigo">“There are directions
        in which I must not for the present let myself go.” </font> Meanwhile I
      returned to her first example—the one to which she had just previously
      referred—of the boy’s happy capacity for an occasional slip. <font color="Indigo">“If Quint—on your remonstrance at the time
        you speak of—was a base menial, one of the things Miles said to you, I find myself guessing, was that you
        were another.” </font> Again her admission was so adequate that I
      continued: <font color="Indigo">“And you
        forgave him that?”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="27"><sup>¶27</sup>
      <font color="Periwinkle">“Wouldn’t <em>you?</em>” </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="28"><sup>¶28</sup>
      <font color="Indigo">“Oh, yes!”</font>
      <font color="sienna">And we exchanged there, in the stillness, a sound
        of the oddest amusement. </font> Then I went on: <font color="Indigo">“At all events, while he was with the
        man—” </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="29"><sup>¶29</sup>
      <font color="Periwinkle">“Miss Flora was with the woman. It suited them
        all!” </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="30"><sup>¶30</sup>It suited me, too, I felt, only too well; by which I mean that it suited
      exactly the particularly deadly view I was in the very act of forbidding
      myself to entertain. But I so far succeeded in checking the expression of
      this view that I will throw, just here, no further light on it than may be
      offered by the mention of my final observation to Mrs. Grose. <font color="Indigo">“His having lied and been impudent are, I confess,
        less engaging specimens than I had hoped to have from you of the
        outbreak in him of the little natural man. Still,” </font> I mused,
      <font color="Indigo">“They must do, for
        they make me feel more than ever <font color="magenta">that I must
          watch.”</font>
      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="31"><sup>¶31</sup>It made me blush, <font color="GreenYellow">the next minute</font>, <font color="magenta">to
        see in my friend’s face </font> how much more unreservedly she had
      forgiven him than her anecdote struck me as presenting to my own tenderness
      an occasion for doing. This came out when, at the schoolroom door, she
      quitted me. <font color="Periwinkle">
        <font color="mediumpurple">“Surely you don’t accuse <em>him</em>—” </font>

    <h3>Chapter: 9</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>
      <font color="mistyrose">I waited and waited,</font> and <font color="GreenYellow">the days</font>,
      as they elapsed, took something from my consternation. A very few of them,
      in fact, passing, <font color="magenta">in constant sight of my
        pupils,</font> without a fresh incident, sufficed to give to grievous
      fancies and even to odious memories a kind of brush of the sponge. I have
      spoken of the surrender to their extraordinary childish grace as a thing I
      could actively cultivate, and it may be imagined if I neglected now to
      address myself to this source for whatever it would yield. Stranger than I
      can express, certainly, was the effort to struggle against my new lights; it
      would doubtless have been, however, a greater tension still had it not been
      so frequently successful. I used to wonder how my little charges could help
      guessing that I thought strange things about them; and the circumstances
      that these things only made them more interesting was not by itself a direct
      aid to keeping them in the dark. <font color="magenta">I trembled
        lest they should see that they <em>were </em> so
        immensely more interesting. </font> Putting things at the worst, at all
      events, as in meditation I so often did, any clouding of their innocence
      could only be—blameless and foredoomed as they were—a reason the more for
      taking risks. There were moments when, by an irresistible impulse, <font color="teal">I found myself catching them up and pressing them
        to my heart. </font> As soon as I had done so I used to say to myself:
      <font color="Indigo">“What will they
        think of that? Doesn’t it betray too much?” </font> It would have been
      easy to get into a sad, wild tangle about how much I might betray; but the
      real account, I feel, of the hours of peace that I could still enjoy was
      that the immediate charm of my companions was a beguilement still effective
      even under the shadow of the possibility that it was studied. For if it
      occurred to me that I might occasionally excite suspicion by the little
      outbreaks of my sharper passion for them, <font color="magenta">so too
        I remember wondering if I mightn’t see a queerness in the traceable
        increase of their own demonstrations. </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>They were at this period extravagantly and preternaturally fond of me; which,
      after all, I could reflect, was no more than a graceful response in children
      perpetually bowed over and hugged. The homage of which they were so lavish
      succeeded, in truth, for my nerves, quite as well as if I never appeared to
      myself, as I may say, <font color="teal">literally to catch them at
        a purpose in it. </font> They had never, I think, wanted to do so many
      things for their poor protectress; I mean—though they got their lessons
      better and better, which was naturally what would please her most—in the way
      of diverting, entertaining, surprising her; reading her passages, telling
      her stories, acting her charades, pouncing out at her, in disguises, as
      animals and historical characters, and above all astonishing her by the
      “pieces” they had secretly got by heart and could interminably recite. I
      should never get to the bottom—were I to let myself go even now—of the
      prodigious private commentary, all under still more private correction, with
      which, in <font color="GreenYellow">these days</font>, I overscored <font color="Olive">their full
        hours</font>. <font color="magenta">
        <font color="magenta">They had shown me</font>
      </font> from the first a facility for
      everything, a general faculty which, taking a fresh start, achieved
      remarkable flights. They got their little tasks as if they loved them, and
      indulged, from the mere exuberance of the gift, in the most unimposed little
      miracles of memory. They not only popped out at me as tigers and as Romans,
      but as Shakespeareans, astronomers, and navigators. This was so singularly
      the case that it had presumably much to do with the fact as to which, at
      <font color="GreenYellow">the present day</font>, I am at a loss for a different
      explanation: I allude to my unnatural composure on the subject of another
      school for Miles. What I remember is that I
      was content not, for the time, to open the question, and that contentment
      must have sprung from the sense of his perpetually striking show of
      cleverness. He was too clever for a bad governess, for a parson’s daughter, to spoil; and the strangest if
      not the brightest thread in the pensive embroidery I just spoke of was the
      impression I might have got, if I had dared to work it out, that hew asunder
      some influence operating in his small intellectual life as a tremendous
      incitement.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup>If it was easy to reflect, however, that such a boy could postpone school, it
      was at least as marked that for such a boy to have been “kicked out” by a
      schoolmaster was a mystification without end. Let me add that in their
      company now—and I was careful almost never to be out of it—<font color="Peru">I could follow no scent very far.</font> We lived
      in a cloud of music and love and success and private theatricals. The
      musical sense in each of the children was of the quickest, <font color="mistyrose">but the elder in especial had a marvelous knack of
        catching and repeating. </font> The schoolroom piano broke into all
      gruesome fancies; and when that failed there were confabulations in corners,
      with a sequel of one of them going out in the highest spirits in order to
      “come in” as something new. I had had brothers myself, and it was no
      revelation to me that little girls could be slavish idolaters of little
      boys. What surpassed everything was that there was a little boy in the world
      who could have for the inferior age, sex, and intelligence so fine a
      consideration. They were extraordinarily at one, and to say that they never
      either quarreled or complained is to make the note of praise coarse for
      their quality of sweetness. Sometimes, indeed, when I dropped into
      coarseness, I perhaps came across traces of little understandings between
      them by which one of them should keep me occupied while the other slipped
      away. There is a <em>naïf </em> side, I suppose, in all
      diplomacy; but if my pupils practiced upon me, it was surely with the
      minimum of grossness. It was all in the other quarter that, after a lull,
      the grossness broke out.</div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="4"><sup>¶4</sup>
      <font color="lightpink">I find that I really hang back; but I must take my
        plunge.</font> In going on with the record of what was hideous at
      Bly, I not only challenge the most liberal faith—for which I little
      care; but—and this is another matter—I renew what I myself suffered, I again
      push my way through it to the end. There came suddenly <font color="Olive">an hour</font>
      after which, as I look back, the affair seems to me to have been all pure
      suffering; but I have at least reached the heart of it, and the straightest
      road out is doubtless to advance. One <font color="Olive">evening</font>—with nothing to
      lead up or to prepare it—<font color="teal">I felt the cold touch
        of the impression that had breathed on me </font> the night of my arrival
      and which, much lighter then, as I have mentioned, I should probably have
      made little of in memory had my subsequent sojourn been less agitated. <font color="lime">I had not gone to bed; I sat reading by a
        couple of candles. There was a roomful of old books at Bly—<font color="GreenYellow">last-century
          fiction</font>, some of it, which, to the extent of a distinctly
        deprecated renown, but never to so much as that of a stray specimen, had
        reached the sequestered home and appealed to the unavowed curiosity of
        my youth. I remember that the book I had in my hand </font> was Fielding’s<em>Amelia</em> ; also that I was wholly awake. I recall further both a general
      conviction that it was horribly late <font color="magenta">and a
        particular objection to looking at my watch. </font> I figure, finally,
      that the white curtain draping, in the fashion
      of <font color="GreenYellow">those days</font>, the head of Flora’s little bed, shrouded, as I had assured myself long
      before, the perfection of childish rest. I recollect in short that, though I
      was deeply interested in my author, I found myself, at the turn of a page
      and with his spell all scattered, <font color="magenta">looking straight up from
        him and hard at the door of my room. </font> There was a moment during
      which I listened, reminded of the faint sense I had had, the first night, of
      there being something undefinably astir in the house, and noted the soft
      breath of the open casement just move the half-drawn blind. Then, with all
      the marks of a deliberation that must have seemed magnificent had there been
      anyone to admire it, <font color="lime">I laid down my
        book,</font> rose to my feet, and, taking a candle, went straight out of
      the room and, from the passage, on which my light made little impression,
      noiselessly closed and locked the door.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="5"><sup>¶5</sup>I can say now neither what determined nor what guided me, but I went straight
      along the lobby, holding my candle high, <font color="magenta">till I
        came within sight of the tall window that presided over the great turn
        of the staircase. </font> At this point I precipitately found myself
      aware of three things. They were practically simultaneous, yet they had
      flashes of succession. My candle, under a bold flourish, went out, and I
      perceived, by the uncovered window, that the yielding dusk of <font color="Olive">earliest
        morning</font> rendered it unnecessary. Without it, the next instant,
      <font color="magenta">I saw that there was someone on the stair.
      </font> I speak of sequences, but I required <font color="Olive">no lapse of seconds</font>
      to stiffen myself for a third encounter with Quint. The apparition had reached the landing halfway up and
      was therefore on the spot nearest the window, <font color="magenta">where at sight of me, it stopped short and fixed me exactly as it had
        fixed me from the tower and from the garden. </font>
      <font color="mistyrose">:He knew me as well as I knew him;</font> and so, in
      the cold, faint twilight, with a glimmer in the high glass and another on
      the polish of the oak stair below, we faced each other in our common
      intensity. He was absolutely, on this occasion, a living, detestable,
      dangerous presence. But that was not the wonder of wonders; I reserve this
      distinction for quite another circumstance: the circumstance that dread had
      unmistakably quitted me and that there was nothing in me there that didn’t
      meet and measure him.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="6"><sup>¶6</sup>I had plenty of anguish after that extraordinary moment, but I had, thank
      God, no terror. And he knew I had not—I found myself at the end of an
      instant magnificently aware of this. I felt, in a fierce rigor of
      confidence, that if I stood my ground a minute I should cease—for the time,
      at least—to have him to reckon with; and during <font color="Olive">the minute</font>,
      accordingly, the thing was as human and hideous as a real interview: hideous
      just because it <em>was</em> human, as human as to have
      met alone, in <font color="Olive">the small hours</font>, in a sleeping house, some enemy,
      some adventurer, some criminal. <font color="sienna">
        <font color="magenta">It was the dead silence of our long
          gaze</font>
      </font> at such close quarters that gave the whole horror, huge
      as it was, its only note of the unnatural. If I had met a murderer in such a
      place and at <font color="Olive">such an hour</font>, we still at least would have spoken.
      Something would have passed,in life, between us; if nothing had passed, one
      of us would have moved.</div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="7"><sup>¶7</sup>The moment was so prolonged that it would have taken but little more to make
      me doubt if even <em>I</em> were in life. I can’t express
      what followed it save by saying that <font color="sienna">the silence
        itself</font>—which was indeed in a manner an attestation of my
      strength—became the element into which <font color="magenta">I saw
        the figure disappear; </font> in which <font color="magenta">:I
        definitely saw it turn as I might have seen the low wretch to which it
        had once belonged turn on receipt of anorder, and pass, with my eyes on
        the villainous back that no hunch could have more disfigured, straight
        down the staircase and into the darkness in which the next bend was
        lost.</font>

    <h3>Chapter: 10</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>I remained awhile at the top of the stair, but with the effect presently of
      understanding that when my visitor had gone, he had gone: then I returned to
      my room. <font color="magenta">The foremost thing I saw there by the
        light of the candle I had left burning was that Flora’s little bed was empty; </font> and on this I
      caught my breath with all the terror that, <font color="Olive">five minutes before</font>,
      I had been able to resist. I dashed at the place in which I had left her
      lying and over which (for the small silk counterpane and the sheets were
      disarranged) the white curtains had been
      deceivingly pulled forward; then my step, to my unutterable relief, <font color="sienna">produced an answering sound:</font>
      <font color="magenta">I perceived an agitation of the window
        blind,</font> and the child, ducking down, emerged rosily from the other
      side of it. She stood there in so much of her candor and so little of her
      nightgown, with her <font color="pink">pink</font> bare feet and the <font color="gold">golden</font> glow of her curls. <font color="magenta">She looked intensely grave,</font> and I had never
      had such a sense of losing an advantage acquired (the thrill of which had
      just been so prodigious) as on my consciousness that she addressed me with a
      reproach. <font color="Indigo">“You naughty:
        where <em>have </em> you been?” </font> —instead of
      challenging her own irregularity I found myself arraigned and explaining.
      She herself explained, for that matter, with the loveliest, eagerest
      simplicity. She had known suddenly, as she lay there, that I was out of the
      room, <font color="magenta">and had jumped up to see what had become of
        me. </font> I had dropped, with the joy of her reappearance, back into my
      chair—feeling then, and then only, a little faint; <font color="teal">and she had pattered straight over to me, thrown herself upon my knee,
        given herself to be held with the flame of the candle full in the
        wonderful little face that was still flushed with sleep. </font>
      <font color="magenta">I remember closing my eyes an instant,
        yieldingly, consciously, as before the excess of something beautiful
        that shone out of the <font color="azure">blue</font> of her own. </font>
      <font color="Indigo">
        <font color="magenta">“You were looking for me out of the
          window?”</font>
      </font> I said. <font color="Indigo">“You
        thought I might be walking in the grounds?” </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>
      <font color="Green">“Well, you know, I thought
        someone was”</font>—she never blanched as she smiled out that at me.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup>
      <font color="magenta">Oh, how I looked at her now!</font>
      <font color="Indigo">“And did you see
        anyone?”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="4"><sup>¶4</sup>
      <font color="Green">“Ah, <em>no!</em>” </font> she returned, almost with the full privilege of
      childish inconsequence, resentfully, though with a long sweetness in her
      little drawl of the negative.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="5"><sup>¶5</sup>At that moment, in the state of my nerves, I absolutely believed she lied;
      <font color="magenta">and if I once more closed my eyes it was
        before the dazzle of the three or four possible ways in which I might
        take this up. </font> One of these, for a moment, tempted me with such
      singular intensity that, to withstand it, <font color="teal">I must
        have gripped my little girl with a spasm that, wonderfully, she
        submitted to without a cry or a sign of fright. </font> Why not break out
      at her on the spot and have it all over?—give it to her straight in her
      lovely little <font color="magenta">lighted</font> face? <font color="Indigo">
        <font color="magenta">“You see, you see,</font> you <em>know</em> that you do and that you already quite
        suspect I believe it; therefore, why not frankly confess it to me, so
        that we may at least live with it together and learn perhaps, in the
        strangeness of our fate, where we are and what it means?”
      </font> This
      solicitation dropped, alas, as it came: if I could immediately have
      succumbed to it I might have spared myself—<font color="magenta">well, you’ll see what.</font> Instead of succumbing I sprang again to my
      feet, <font color="magenta">looked at her bed,</font> and took a
      helpless middle way.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="6"><sup>¶6</sup>
      <font color="Indigo">“Why did you pull the

    <div class="paragraph" n="7"><sup>¶7</sup>Flora<font color="magenta">luminously considered</font>; after which, with
      her little divine smile: <font color="Green">“Because I don’t like to frighten you!”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="8"><sup>¶8</sup>
      <font color="Indigo">“But if I had, by your
        idea, gone out—?”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="9"><sup>¶9</sup>She absolutely declined to be puzzled; she <font color="magenta">turned
        her eyes </font> to the <font color="maroon">flame of the candle</font> as if
      the question were as irrelevant, or at any rate as impersonal, as Mrs.
      Marcet or nine-times-nine. <font color="Green">“Oh, but you know,” </font> she quite adequately answered, <font color="Green">“that you might come back,
        you dear, and that you <em>have!</em>” </font> And
      after a little, when she had got into bed, I had, for a long time,<font color="teal">by almost sitting on her to hold her hand, </font>
      to prove that I recognized the pertinence of my return.</div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="10"><sup>¶10</sup>You may imagine the general complexion, from that moment, of <font color="GreenYellow">my
        nights</font>. I <font color="mistyrose">repeatedly </font> sat up till I
      didn’t know when; I selected moments when my roommate unmistakably slept,
      and, stealing out, took noiseless turns in the passage and even pushed as
      far as to where I had last met Quint.</div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="11"><sup>¶11</sup>But I never met him there again; and I may as well say at once that I on no
      other occasion <font color="magenta">saw him in the house.</font> I just
      missed, on the staircase, on the other hand, a different adventure. <font color="magenta">Looking down it from the top I once recognized the
        presence of a woman seated on one of the lower steps with her back
        presented to me, her body half-bowed and her head, in an attitude of
        woe, in her hands. </font> I had been there but an instant, however, <font color="magenta">when she vanished without looking round at me. </font>
      <font color="magenta">I knew, nonetheless, exactly what dreadful face
        she had to show;</font> and I wondered whether, if instead of being above
      I had been below, I should have had, for going up, the same nerve I had
      lately shown Quint. Well, there
      continued to be plenty of chance for nerve. On the eleventh night after my
      latest encounter with that gentleman—they were all numbered now—I had an
      alarm that perilously skirted it and that indeed, from the particular
      quality of its unexpectedness, proved quite my sharpest shock. It was
      precisely the first night during this series that, weary with watching, I
      had felt that I might again without laxity lay myself down at <font color="Olive">my old
        hour</font>. I slept immediately and, as I afterward knew, till about
      one o’clock; but when I woke it was to sit straight up, as completely roused
      <font color="teal">as if a hand had shook me.</font>
      <font color="maroon">I had left a light burning, but it was now out, and I felt
        an instant certainty that Flora had
        extinguished it. </font> This brought me to my feet and straight, in the
      darkness, to her bed, which I found she had left. <font color="magenta">A glance at the window enlightened me further, and the striking of a
        match completed the picture. </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="12"><sup>¶12</sup>The child had again got up— <font color="maroon">this time blowing out the taper, </font>
      <font color="magenta">and had again, for some purpose of observation or
        response, squeezed in behind the blind and was peering out into the
        night. </font>
      <font color="magenta">That she now saw—as she had not, I had satisfied
        myself, the previous time—was proved to me by the fact that she was
        disturbed neither by my reillumination nor by the haste I made to get
        into slippers and into a wrap. </font> Hidden, protected, absorbed, she
      evidently rested on the sill—the casement opened forward—and gave herself
      up. There was a great still moon to help her, and this fact had counted in
      my quick decision. <font color="magenta">She was face to face with the
        apparition we had met at the lake, and could now communicate with it as
        she had not then been able to do. </font> What I, on my side, had to care
      for was, without disturbing her, to reach, from the corridor, some other
      window in the same quarter. <font color="sienna">I got to the door
        without her hearing me; </font> I got out of it, closed it, and listened,
      from the other side, for some sound from her. While I stood in the passage
      <font color="magenta">I had my eyes on her brother’s door,</font>
      which was but ten steps off and which, indescribably, produced in me a
      renewal of the strange impulse that I lately spoke of as my temptation. What
      if I should go straight in and march to <em>his </em>
      window?—what if, by risking to his boyish bewilderment a revelation of my
      motive, I should throw across the rest of the mystery the long halter of my
      boldness?
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="13"><sup>¶13</sup>This thought <font color="teal">held me sufficiently</font> to make
      me cross to his threshold and pause again. I preternaturally listened; I
      figured to myself what might portentously be; I wondered if his bed were
      also empty and <font color="magenta">he too were secretly at watch. </font>
      <font color="sienna">It was a deep, soundless minute,</font> at the end
      of which my impulse failed. <font color="sienna">He was quiet; he might
        be innocent;</font> the risk was hideous; I turned away. There was a
      figure in the grounds—<font color="magenta">a figure prowling for a
        sight, </font> the visitor with whom Flora was engaged; but it was not the visitor most concerned
      with my boy. <font color="lightpink">I hesitated afresh, but on other grounds and
        only for <font color="Olive">a few seconds</font>; then I had made my choice.
      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="14"><sup>¶14</sup>There were empty rooms at Bly, and it was only a question of choosing the right one. The
      right one suddenly presented itself to me as the lower one—though high above
      the gardens—in the solid corner of the house that I have spoken of as the
      old tower. This was a large, square chamber, arranged with some state as a
      bedroom, the extravagant size of which made it so inconvenient that it had
      not for <font color="GreenYellow">years</font>, though kept by Mrs.
      Grose in exemplary order, been occupied. I had often admired
      it and I knew my way about in it; I had only, after just faltering at the
      first chill gloom of its disuse, to pass across it <font color="sienna">and unbolt as quietly as I could one of the shutters. </font>
      <font color="sienna">Achieving this transit, I uncovered the glass
        without a sound</font> and, applying my face to the pane, was able, <font color="magenta">the darkness without being much less than within,
        to see that I commanded the right direction. Then I saw something more.
        The moon made the night extraordinarily penetrable and showed me on the
        lawn a person, diminished by distance, who stood there motionless and as
        if fascinated, looking up to where I had appeared—looking, that is, not
        so much straight at me as at something that was apparently above
        me.</font> There was clearly another person above me—there was a person
      on the tower; but the presence on the lawn was not in the least what I had
      conceived and had confidently hurried to meet. The presence on the lawn—I
      felt sick as I made it out—was poor little Miles himself.

    <h3>Chapter: 11</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>It was not till <font color="GreenYellow">late next day</font> that I spoke to Mrs. Grose; <font color="magenta">the
        rigor with which I kept my pupils in sight </font> making it often
      difficult to meet her privately, and the more as we each felt the importance
      of not provoking—on the part of the servants quite as much as on that of the
      children—any suspicion of a secret flurry or that of a discussion of
      mysteries. <font color="magenta">I drew a great security in this
        particular from her mere smooth aspect. There was nothing in her fresh
        face to pass on to others my horrible confidences. </font> She believed
      me, I was sure, absolutely: if she hadn’t I don’t know what would have
      become of me, for I couldn’t have borne the business alone. But she was a
      magnificent monument to the blessing of a want of imagination, <font color="magenta">and if she could see in our little charges </font>
      nothing but their beauty and amiability, their happiness and cleverness, she
      had no direct communication with the sources of my trouble. <font color="magenta">If they had been at all visibly blighted or
        battered, </font> she would doubtless have grown, on tracing it back,
      haggard enough to match them; as matters stood, however, I could feel her,
      <font color="magenta">when she surveyed them,</font> with her large
      white arms folded <font color="magenta">and the habit of serenity in all her look,</font>
      thank the Lord’s mercy that if they were ruined the pieces would still
      serve. Flights of fancy gave place, in her mind, <font color="maroon">to a steady
        fireside glow,</font> and I had already begun to perceive how, with the
      development of the conviction that—as time went on without a public
      accident—our young things could, after all, look out for themselves, she
      addressed her greatest solicitude to the sad case presented by their
      instructress. That, for myself, was a sound simplification: I could engage
      that, to the world, <font color="magenta">my face should tell no
        tales,</font> but it would have been, in the conditions, an immense added
      strain to find myself anxious about hers.

      the terrace, where, with the lapse of the <font color="GreenYellow">season</font>,
      the afternoon sun was now agreeable; and we sat there together while, before
      us, at a distance, but within call if we wished, the children strolled to
      and fro in one of their most manageable moods. They moved slowly, in unison,
      below us, over the lawn, the boy, as they went, <font color="lime">reading aloud from a storybook</font> and <font color="teal">passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in touch. </font>
      <font color="magenta">Mrs. Grose
        watched them with positive placidity;</font> then I caught the <font color="sienna">suppressed intellectual creak with which she
        conscientiously turned to take from me a view of the back of the
        tapestry. </font> I had made her a receptacle of lurid things, but there
      was an odd recognition of my superiority—my accomplishments and my
      function—in her patience under my pain. She offred her mind to my
      disclosures as, had I wished to mix a witch’s broth and proposed it with
      assurance, she would have held out a large clean saucepan. This had become
      thoroughly her attitude by the time that, in my recital of the events of
      <font color="Olive">the night</font>, I reached the point of what Miles had said to me when, <font color="magenta">after seeing him, at such a monstrous hour, almost
        on the very spot where he happened now to be, </font> I had gone down to
      bring him in; choosing then, at the window, with a concentrated need of not
      alarming the house, rather that method than a signal more resonant. I had
      left her meanwhile in little doubt of my small hope of representing with
      success even to her actual sympathy my sense of the real splendor of the
      little inspiration with which, after I had got him into the house, the boy
      met my final articulate challenge. <font color="magenta">As soon as I
        appeared in the moonlight on the terrace, he had come to me as straight
        as possible; </font>
      <font color="teal">on which I had taken his hand without a word and
        led him, through the dark spaces, up the staircase where Quint had so hungrily hovered for him,
      </font> along the lobby <font color="sienna">where I had listened and
        trembled, and so to his forsaken room.</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup>
      <font color="sienna">Not a sound, on the way, had passed between
        us,</font> and I had wondered—oh, <em>how</em> I had
      wondered!—<font color="teal">if he were groping about in his
        little mind for something plausible and not too grotesque. </font> It
      would tax his invention, certainly, and I felt, this time, over his real
      embarrassment, a curious thrill of triumph. It was a sharp trap for the
      inscrutable! He couldn’t play any longer at innocence; so how the deuce
      would he get out of it? There beat in me indeed, with the passionate throb
      of this question an equal dumb appeal as to how the deuce <em>I</em> should. I was confronted at last, as never yet,
      with all the risk attached even now to sounding my own horrid note. I
      remember in fact that as we pushed into his little chamber, where the bed
      had not been slept in at all and the window, uncovered to the moonlight,
      made the place so clear that there was no need of striking a match—I
      remember how I suddenly dropped, sank upon the edge of the bed from the
      force of the idea that he must know how he really, as they say, “had” me. He
      could do what he liked, with all his cleverness to help him, so long as I
      should continue to defer to the old tradition of the criminality of those
      caretakers of the young who minister to superstitions and fears. He “had” me
      indeed, and in a cleft stick; for who would ever absolve me, who would
      consent that I should go unhung, if, by the faintest tremor of an overture,
      I were the first to introduce into our perfect intercourse an element so
      dire? No, no: it was useless to attempt to convey to Mrs. Grose, just as it is scarcely less so to
      attempt to suggest here, <font color="teal">how, in our short, stiff
        brush in the dark, he fairly shook me with admiration. </font> I was of
      course thoroughly kind and merciful; <font color="teal">never, never
        yet had I placed on his little shoulders hands of such tenderness as
        those with which, while I rested against the bed, I held him there well </font>
      <font color="maroon">under fire.</font> I had no alternative but, in form at
      least, to put it to him.

      as ever an effort beyond my strength—offered, in close quarters,
      difficulties as insurmountable as before. This situation continued <font color="GreenYellow">a
        month</font>, and with new aggravations and particular notes, the note
      above all, sharper and sharper, of the small ironic consciousness on the

      then, my mere infernal imagination: it was absolutely traceable that they
      were aware of my predicament and that this strange relation made, in a
      manner, for a long time, the air in which we moved. I don’t mean that they
      had their tongues in their cheeks or did anything vulgar, for that was not
      one of their dangers: I do mean, on the other hand, that the element of the
      unnamed and untouched became, between us, greater than any other, and that
      so much avoidance could not have been so successfully effected without a
      great deal of tacit arrangement. <font color="magenta">It was as if,

      </font> All roads lead to Rome, and there were times
      when it might have struck us that almost every branch of study or subject of
      conversation skirted forbidden ground. Forbidden ground was the question of
      the return of the dead in general and of whatever, in especial, might
      survive, in memory, of the friends little children had lost. There were days
      when I could have sworn that one of them had, with a small invisible nudge,
      said to the other: “She thinks she’ll do it this time—but she <em>won’t!</em>” To “do it” would have been to
      indulge for instance—and for once in a way—in some direct reference to the
      lady who had prepared them for my discipline. They had a delightful endless
      appetite for passages in my own history, to which I had again and again
      treated them; they were in possession of everything that had ever happened
      to me, had had, with every circumstance the story of my smallest adventures
      and of those of my brothers and sisters and of the cat and the dog at home,
      as well as many particulars of the eccentric nature of my father, of the
      furniture and arrangement of our house, and of the conversation of the old
      women of our village. There were things enough, taking one with another, to
      chatter about, if one went very fast and knew by instinct when to go round.
      They pulled with an art of their own the strings of my invention and my
      memory; <font color="magenta">and nothing else perhaps, when I
        thought of such occasions afterward, gave me so the suspicion of being
        watched from under cover. </font> It was in any case over <em>my</em> life, <em>my</em> past, and
      <em>my </em> friends alone that we could take
      anything like our ease—a state of affairs that led them sometimes without
      the least pertinence to break out into sociable reminders. I was
      invited—with no visible connection—to repeat afresh Goody Gosling’s
      celebrated <em><em>mot</em></em> or to confirm the details already supplied as to the cleverness
      of the vicarage pony.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>It was partly at such junctures as these and partly at quite different ones
      that, with the turn my matters had now taken, my predicament, as I have
      called it, grew most sensible. The fact that the days passed for me without
      another encounter ought, it would have appeared, to have done something
      toward soothing my nerves. <font color="teal">Since the light brush,
        that <font color="GreenYellow">second night</font> on the upper landing, of the presence of
        a woman at the foot of the stair, </font>
      <font color="magenta">I had seen nothing, whether in or out of the
        house, that one had better not have seen. </font> There was many a corner
      round which I expected to come upon Quint, and many a situation that, in a merely sinister way,
      would have favored the appearance of Miss
      Jessel. <font color="GreenYellow">The summer had turned, the summer
        had gone</font>; the autumn had dropped upon Bly and had blown out half our lights. The place, with its <font color="gray">gray </font> sky and withered garlands, its bared
      spaces and scattered dead leaves, was like a theater after the
      performance—all strewn with crumpled playbills. There were exactly states of
      the air, conditions of sound and of stillness, unspeakable impressions of
      the <em>kind</em> of ministering moment, that brought
      back to me, <font color="teal">long enough to catch it,</font> the
      feeling of the medium in which, that <font color="GreenYellow">June</font> evening
      out of doors, <font color="magenta">I had had my first sight of
        Quint, and in which, too, at
        those other instants, I had, after seeing him through the window, looked
        for him in vain in the circle of shrubbery. </font>
      <font color="mediumblue">I recognized the signs, the portents—I
        recognized the moment, the spot. </font> But they remained unaccompanied
      and empty, and I continued unmolested; if unmolested one could call a young
      woman whose sensibility had, in the most extraordinary fashion, not declined
      but deepened. I had said in my talk with Mrs.
      Grose on that horrid scene of Flora’s by the lake—and had perplexed her by so saying—that
      it would from that moment distress me much more to lose my power than to
      keep it. I had then expressed what was vividly in my mind: the truth that,
      <font color="magenta">whether the children really saw or not—since,
        that is, it was not yet definitely proved—I greatly preferred, as a
        safeguard, the fullness of my own exposure. </font> I was ready to know
      the very worst that was to be known. What I had then had an ugly glimpse of
      was that <font color="magenta">my eyes might be sealed</font> just
      while theirs were most opened. <font color="mistyrose">Well, my eyes <em>were</em> sealed, </font> it appeared, at present—a
      consummation for which it seemed blasphemous not to thank God. There was,
      alas, a difficulty about that: I would have thanked him with all my soul had
      I not had in a proportionate measure this conviction of the secret of my
      pupils. How can I retrace <font color="GreenYellow">today</font> the strange steps of my
      obsession? There were times of our being together when I would have been
      ready to swear that, literally, in my presence, but with my direct sense of
      it closed, they had visitors who were known and were welcome. Then it was
      that, had I not been deterred by the very chance that such an injury might
      prove greater than the injury to be averted, my exultation would have broken
      out. <font color="Indigo">“They’re here, they’re here, you
        little wretches,” </font> I would have cried, <font color="Indigo">“and you can’t deny it now!”</font>. <font color="mistyrose">The little wretches </font> denied it with all the added volume of their
      sociability and their tenderness, in just the crystal depths of which—like
      the flash of a fish in a stream—the mockery of their advantage peeped up.
      The shock, in truth, had sunk into me still deeper than I knew on the night
      when, <font color="magenta">looking out to see either Quint or Miss
        Jessel under the stars, </font> I had beheld the boy over
      whose rest I watched and who had immediately brought in with him—had
      straightway, there, turned it on me—the lovely upward look with which, from
      the battlements above me, the hideous apparition of Quint had played. If it was a question of a
      scare, my discovery on this occasion had scared me more than any other, and
      it was in the condition of nerves produced by it that I made my actual
      inductions. They harassed me so that sometimes, at odd moments, <font color="sienna">I shut myself up audibly to rehearse—it was at once
        a fantastic relief and a renewed despair—the manner in which I might
        come to the point. </font> I approached it from one side and the other
      while, in my room, I flung myself about, but I always broke down in the
      monstrous utterance of names. As they died away on my lips, I said to myself
      that I should indeed help them to represent something infamous, if, by
      pronouncing them, I should violate as rare a little case of instinctive
      delicacy as any schoolroom, probably, had ever known. When I said to myself:
      <font color="Indigo">“<em>They</em>
        have the manners to be silent, and you, trusted as you are, the baseness
        to speak!” </font> I felt myself <font color="crimson">crimson</font>
      and <font color="teal">I covered my face with my hands. </font>
      <font color="sienna">After these secret scenes I chattered more than
        ever, going on volubly enough till one of our prodigious, palpable
        hushes occurred—I can call them nothing else—the strange, dizzy lift or
        swim (I try for terms!) into a stillness, a pause of all life, that had
        nothing to do with the more or less noise that at the moment we might be
        engaged in making and that I could hear through any deepened
        exhilaration or quickened recitation or louder strum of the piano.
      </font> Then it was that the others, the outsiders, were there. Though they
      were not angels, they “passed,” as the French say, causing me, while they
      stayed, to tremble with the fear of their addressing to their younger
      victims some yet more infernal message or more vivid image than they had
      thought good enough for myself.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup>What it was most impossible to get rid of was the cruel idea that, <font color="magenta">whatever I had seen, </font>
      <font color="magenta">Miles and Flora saw <em>more</em>—things terrible and unguessable </font> and that sprang from
      dreadful passages of intercourse in the past. Such things naturally left on
      the surface, for the time, a chill which we vociferously denied that we
      felt; and we had, all three, with <font color="mistyrose">repetition</font>,
      got into such splendid training that we went, each time, almost
      automatically, to mark the close of the incident, through the very same
      movements. It was striking of the children, at all events, to kiss me
      inveterately with a kind of wild irrelevance and never to fail—one or the
      other—of the precious question that had helped us through many a peril.
      <font color="Periwinkle">“When do you think
        he _will_ come? Don’t you think <font color="bisque">we <em>ought</em> to write?” </font>
      </font> —there was nothing like that inquiry, we found by experience, for
      carrying off an awkwardness. “He” of course was their uncle
      in Harley Street; and we lived in much profusion of theory that he might at any
      moment arrive to mingle in our circle. It was impossible to have given less
      encouragement than he had done to such a doctrine, but if we had not had the
      doctrine to fall back upon we should have deprived each other of some of our
      finest exhibitions. <font color="purple">He never wrote to
        them</font>—that may have been selfish, but it was a part of the flattery of
      his trust of me; for the way in which a man pays his highest tribute to a
      woman is apt to be but by the more festal celebration of one of the sacred
      laws of his comfort; and I held that I carried out the spirit of the pledge
      given not to appeal to him <font color="bisque">when I let my charges
        understand that their own letters were but charming literary exercises.
        They were too beautiful to be posted; I kept them myself; I have them
        all to this hour. </font> This was a rule indeed which only added to the
      satiric effect of my being plied with the supposition that he might at any
      moment be among us. It was exactly as if my charges knew how almost more
      awkward than anything else that might be for me. <font color="magenta">There appears to me, moreover, as I look back,
      </font> no note in all this more extraordinary than the mere fact that, in
      spite of my tension and of their triumph, I never lost patience with them.
      Adorable they must in truth have been, I now reflect, that I didn’t in these
      days hate them! Would exasperation, however, if relief had longer been
      postponed, finally have betrayed me? It little matters, for relief arrived.
      I call it relief, though it was only the relief that a snap brings to a
      strain or the burst of a thunderstorm to a day of suffocation. It was at
      least change, and it came with a rush.

    <h3>Chapter: 14</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>Walking to church a certain <font color="GreenYellow">Sunday</font>
      <font color="Olive">morning</font>, I had little Miles at
      my side and his sister, in advance of us and at Mrs. Grose’s, well in sight. <font color="lightpink">It was a
        crisp, clear day, the first of its order for some time; <font color="Olive">the
          night</font> had brought a touch of frost, and the autumn air,
        bright and sharp, </font> made the church bells almost gay. It was an odd
      accident of thought that I should have happened at such a moment to be
      particularly and very gratefully struck with the obedience of my little
      charges. Why did they never resent my inexorable, my perpetual society?
      Something or other had brought nearer home to me <font color="teal">that I had all but pinned the boy to my shawl and that, </font> in the
      way our companions were marshaled before me, I might have appeared to
      provide against some danger of rebellion. <font color="magenta">
        <font color="magenta">I was like a gaoler with an eye to possible
          surprises and escapes.</font>
      </font> But all this belonged—I mean
      their magnificent little surrender—just to the special array of the facts
      that were most abysmal. Turned out for <font color="GreenYellow">Sunday</font> by his uncle’s
      tailor, who had had a free hand and a notion of pretty waistcoats and of his
      grand little air, Miles’s whole title to
      independence, the rights of his sex and situation, were so stamped upon him
      that if he had suddenly struck for freedom I should have had nothing to say.
      I was by the strangest of chances wondering how I should meet him when the
      revolution unmistakably occurred. I call it a revolution because <font color="magenta">I now see how, </font> with the word he spoke,
      the curtain rose on the last act of my dreadful drama, and the catastrophe
      was precipitated. <font color="Goldenrod"> “Look
        here, my dear, you know,” </font> he charmingly said, <font color="Goldenrod">“when in the world, please, am I going
        back to school?” </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>
      <font color="whitesmoke">Transcribed here the speech sounds harmless enough,</font>
      <font color="sienna">particularly as uttered in the sweet, high, casual
        pipe with which, at all interlocutors, but above all at his eternal governess, he threw off
        intonations as if he were tossing roses. </font>
      <font color="teal">There was something in them that always made one
        “catch,” and I caught, </font> at any rate, now so effectually that I
      stopped as short as if one of the trees of the park had fallen across the
      road. There was something new, on the spot, between us, and he was perfectly
      aware that I recognized it, though, toenable me to do so, he had no need to
      look a whit less candid and charming than usual. I could feel in him how he
      already, from my at first finding nothing to reply, perceived the advantage
      he had gained. I was so slow to find anything that he had plenty of time,
      after <font color="Olive">a minute</font>, to continue with his suggestive but
      inconclusive smile: <font color="Goldenrod">“You
        know, my dear, that for a fellow to be with a lady <em>always</em>—!” </font> His “my dear” was
      constantly on his lips for me, and nothing could have expressed more the
      exact shade of the sentiment with which I desired to inspire my pupils than
      its fond familiarity. It was so respectfully easy.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup>But, oh, how I felt that at present I must pick my own phrases! I remember
      that, to gain time, I tried to laugh, and <font color="magenta">I

        and queer I looked. </font>

      </font> We had <font color="magenta">arrived within sight of the
        church</font> and of various persons, including several of the household
      of Bly, on their way to it and clustered about the door to see us go
      in. I quickened our step; I wanted to get there before the question between
      us opened up much further; I reflected hungrily that, <font color="Olive">for more than an
        hour</font>, he would have to be silent; and I thought with envy of the
      comparative <font color="Olive">dusk</font> of the pew and of the almost spiritual help of
      the hassock on which I might bend my knees. I seemed literally to be running
      a race with some confusion to which he was about to reduce me, but I felt
      that he had got in first when, before we had even entered the churchyard, he
      threw out— <font color="Goldenrod">“I want my own

      leaving his thought so unfinished that, after we had come into the gate,
      another stop, <font color="teal">which he imposed on me by the

      followed, and we were, for <font color="Olive">the minute</font>, alone among the old,

    <h3>Chapter: 15</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>The business was practically settled from the moment I never followed him. It
      was a pitiful surrender to agitation, but my being aware of this had somehow
      no power to restore me. I only sat there on my tomb and <font color="lime">read into what my little friend had said to me
        the fullness of its meaning; </font> by the time I had grasped the whole
      of which I had also embraced, for absence, the pretext that I was ashamed to
      offer my pupils and the rest of the congregation such an example of delay.
      What I said to myself above all was that Miles had got something out of me and that the proof of it,
      for him, would be just this awkward collapse. He had got out of me that
      there was something I was much afraid of and that he should probably be able
      to make use of my fear to gain, for his own purpose, more freedom. My fear
      was of having to deal with the intolerable question of the grounds of his
      dismissal from school, for that was really but the question of the horrors
      gathered behind. <font color="lightpink">That his uncle should arrive to treat with
        me of these things was a solution that, strictly speaking, I ought now
        to have desired to bring on; but I could so little face the ugliness and
        the pain of it that I simply procrastinated and lived from hand to
        mouth. </font> The boy, to my deep discomposure, was immensely in the
      right, was in a position to say to me: <font color="Indigo">“Either you clear up with my guardian the mystery of this <font color="mediumpurple"> interruption of my studies, </font> or you
        cease to expect me to lead with you a life that’s so unnatural for a
        boy.” </font> What was so unnatural for the particular boy I was concerned with
      was this sudden revelation of a consciousness and a plan.</div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>That was what really overcame me, what prevented my going in. I walked round
      the church, <font color="lightpink">hesitating, hovering;</font> I reflected that I
      had already, with him, hurt myself beyond repair. Therefore I could patch up
      nothing, <font color="teal">and it was too extreme an effort to
        squeeze beside him into the pew: he would be so much more sure than ever
        to pass his arm into mine and make me sit there for <font color="Olive">an hour</font>
        in close, silent contact with his commentary on our talk. </font> For the
      <font color="Olive">first minute</font> since his arrival I wanted to get away from
      him. <font color="lightpink">As I paused beneath the high east window </font> and
      <font color="sienna">listened to the sounds of worship,</font> I was
      taken with an impulse that might master me, I felt, completely should I give
      it the least encouragement. I might easily put an end to my predicament by
      getting away altogether. Here was my chance; there was no one to stop me; I
      could give the whole thing up—turn my back and retreat. It was only a
      question of hurrying again, for a few preparations, to the house which the
      attendance at church of so many of the servants would practically have left
      unoccupied. No one, in short, could blame me if I should just drive
      desperately off. What was it to get away if I got away only till dinner?
      That would be <font color="Olive">in a couple of hours</font>, at the end of which—I had
      the acute prevision—my little pupils would play at innocent wonder about my
      nonappearance in their train.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup>“What <em>did</em> you do, you naughty, bad thing? Why in the
      world, to worry us so—and take our thoughts off, too, don’t you
      know?—did you desert us at the very door?” <font color="magenta">I couldn’t meet such questions nor, as they asked
        them, their false little lovely eyes; </font> yet it was all so exactly
      what I should have to meet that, as the prospect grew sharp to me, I at last
      let myself go.</div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="4"><sup>¶4</sup>I got, so far as the immediate moment was concerned, away; I came straight
      out of the churchyard and, thinking hard, retraced my steps through the
      park. It seemed to me that by the time I reached the house I had made up my
      mind I would fly. The <font color="GreenYellow">Sunday</font> stillness both of the approaches
      and of the interior, in which I met no one, fairly excited me with a sense
      of opportunity. Were I to get off quickly, this way, I should get off
      without a scene, without a word. My quickness would have to be remarkable,
      however, and the question of a conveyance was the great one to settle.
      Tormented, in the hall, with difficulties and obstacles, I remember sinking
      down at the foot of the staircase—suddenly collapsing there on the lowest
      step and then, with a revulsion, recalling that it was exactly where more
      than <font color="GreenYellow">a month</font> before, <font color="magenta">in the darkness
        of night and just so bowed with evil things, I had seen the specter of
        the most horrible of women. </font> At this I was able to straighten
      myself; I went the rest of the way up; I made, in my bewilderment, for the
      schoolroom, where there were objects belonging to me that I should have to
      take. <font color="magenta">But I opened the door to find again, in a
        flash, my eyes unsealed. </font>
      <font color="magenta">In the presence of what I saw I reeled straight
        back upon my resistance. </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="5"><sup>¶5</sup>Seated at my own table in clear noonday light I saw a person whom, without my
      previous experience, I should have taken at the first blush for some
      housemaid who might have stayed at home to look after the place and who,
      availing herself of rare relief from observation and of the schoolroom <font color="lemonchiffon">table and my pens, ink, and paper, had applied
        herself to the considerable effort of a letter to her sweetheart. </font>
      There was an effort in the way that, while her arms rested on the table, her
      hands with evident weariness supported her head; but at the moment I took
      this in I had already become aware that, in spite of my entrance, her
      attitude strangely persisted. Then it was—with the very act of its
      announcing itself—that her identity flared up in a change of posture. She
      rose, not as if she had heard me, but with an indescribable grand melancholy
      of indifference and detachment, and, within a dozen feet of me, stood there
      as my vile predecessor. Dishonored and tragic, she was all before me; <font color="magenta">
        <font color="teal">but even as I fixed
          and, for memory, secured it, the awful image passed
          away.</font>
      </font> Dark as <font color="Olive">midnight</font> in her <font color="plum">black</font> dress, her haggard beauty and her
      unutterable woe, <font color="magenta">she had looked at me </font> long
      enough to appear to say that her right to sit at my table was as good as
      mine to sit at hers. While these instants lasted, indeed, I had the
      extraordinary chill of feeling that it was I who was the intruder. It was as
      a wild protest against it that, actually addressing her—<font color="Indigo">“You terrible,
        miserable woman!”</font>— <font color="sienna">I heard myself break
        into a sound that, by the open door, rang through the long passage and
        the empty house. </font>
      <font color="magenta">She looked at me</font>
      <font color="sienna">as if she heard me,</font> but I had recovered
      myself and cleared the air. There was nothing in the room the next minute
      but the sunshine and a sense that I must stay.

    <h3>Chapter: 16</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>I had so perfectly expected that the return of my pupils would be marked by a
      demonstration that I was freshly upset at having to take into account that
      they were dumb about my absence. Instead of gaily denouncing and caressing
      me, they made no allusion to my having failed them, and I was left, for the
      time, on perceiving that she too said nothing, to study Mrs. Grose’s odd face. I did this to such
      purpose that I made sure they had in some way bribed her to silence; a
      silence that, however, I would engage to break down on the first private
      opportunity. This opportunity came before tea: I secured <font color="Olive">five
        minutes</font> with her in the housekeeper’s room, where, in the
      twilight, <font color="Peru">amid a smell of lately baked

      <font color="Indigo">“I say, you there—come in.”</font> It was
      a gaiety in the gloom! <font color="maroon"> I went in with my light </font> and
      found him, in bed, very wide awake, but very much at his ease. <font color="Goldenrod">“Well, what are <em>you </em> up to?” </font> he asked with a grace of
      sociability in which it occurred to me that Mrs.

      proof that anything was “out.”

    <div class="paragraph" n="18"><sup>¶18</sup>Something in his tone and the expression of his face, as I got this from him,
      set my heart aching with such a pang as it had never yet known; so
      unutterably touching was it to see his little brain puzzled and his little
      resources taxed to play, under the spell laid on him, a part of innocence
      and consistency. <font color="Indigo">“No,
        never—from <font color="Olive">the hour</font> you came back. You’ve never mentioned

      secret precocity (or whatever I might call the poison of an influence that I
      dared but half to phrase) made him, in spite of the faint breath of his
      inward trouble, appear as accessible as an older person—imposed him almost
      as an intellectual equal. <font color="Indigo">“I thought you wanted to go on as you are.” </font>

      knew in a moment after this that I had gone too far. The answer to my appeal
      was instantaneous, but it came in the form of an extraordinary blast and
      chill, a gust of frozen air, and a shake of the room as great as if, in the
      wild wind, the casement had crashed in. <font color="sienna">The boy
        gave a loud, high shriek, which, lost in the rest of the shock of sound,
      </font> might have seemed, indistinctly, though I was so close to him, a note

      conscious of darkness. So for a moment we remained, while <font color="magenta">I stared about me and saw that the drawn curtains

    <h3>Chapter: 18</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>
      <font color="GreenYellow">The next day</font>, after lessons, Mrs.
      Grose found a moment to say to me quietly: <font color="Periwinkle">
        <font color="bisque">“Have you written, miss?”</font>
      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>
      <font color="Indigo">
        <font color="bisque">“Yes—I’ve written.”</font>
      </font> But I didn’t add—for <font color="Olive">the hour</font>—that <font color="bisque">my letter, sealed and directed, was still in my pocket. </font> There
      would be time enough to send it before the messenger should go to the
      village. Meanwhile there had been, on the part of my pupils, no more
      brilliant, more exemplary morning. It was exactly as if they had both had at
      heart to gloss over any recent little friction. They performed the dizziest
      feats of arithmetic, soaring quite out of <em>my</em>
      feeble range, and perpetrated, in higher spirits than ever, geographical and
      historical jokes. It was conspicuous of course in Miles in particular that he appeared to wish to show how
      easily he could let me down. This child, to my memory, really lives in a
      setting of beauty and misery that no words can translate; there was a
      distinction all his own in every impulse he revealed; never was a small
      natural creature, <font color="magenta">to the uninitiated eye</font>
      all frankness and freedom, a more ingenious, a more extraordinary little
      gentleman. I had perpetually to guard against the wonder of contemplation
      into which <font color="magenta">my initiated view betrayed me; to
        check the irrelevant gaze </font> and <font color="sienna">discouraged sigh</font> in which I constantly both attacked and
      renounced the enigma of what such a little gentleman could have done that
      deserved a penalty. Say that, by the dark prodigy I knew, the imagination of
      all evil <em> had </em> been opened up to him: all the
      justice within me ached for the proof that it could ever have flowered into
      an act.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup>He had never, at any rate, been such a little gentleman as when, after our
      early dinner on <font color="GreenYellow">this dreadful day</font>, he came round to me and
      asked if I shouldn’t like him, for <font color="Olive">half an hour</font>, to play to me.
      David playing to Saul could never have shown
      a finer sense of the occasion. It was literally a charming exhibition of
      tact, of magnanimity, and quite tantamount to his saying outright: <font color="Indigo">“The true knights we love to read about never push an advantage
        too far. I know what you mean now: you mean that—to be let alone
        yourself and not followed up—you’ll cease to worry and spy upon me,
        won’t keep me so close to you, will let me go and come. Well, I
        ‘come,’ you see—but I don’t go! There’ll be plenty of time for that.
        I do really delight in your society, and I only want to show you
        that I contended for a principle.” </font> It may be imagined whether I resisted this appeal <font color="teal">or failed to accompany him again, hand in hand,
      </font> to the schoolroom. <font color="sienna">He sat down at the old
        piano and played as he had never played; </font> and if there are those
      who think he had better have been kicking a football I can only say that I
      wholly agree with them. For at the end of a time that under his influence I
      had quite ceased to measure, I started up with a strange sense of having
      literally slept at my post. It was after luncheon, <font color="maroon">and by
        the schoolroom fire, </font> and yet I hadn’t really, in the least,
      slept: I had only done something much worse—I had forgotten. Where, all this
      time, was Flora? When I put the question to
      Miles, he played on <font color="Olive">a
        minute</font> before answering and then could only say: <font color="Goldenrod">“Why, my dear, how do <em>I </em> know?” </font> —breaking moreover into a
      happy laugh which, immediately after, as if it were a vocal accompaniment,
      he prolonged into incoherent, extravagant song. I went straight to my room,
      but his sister was not there; then, before going downstairs, <font color="magenta">I looked into several others. </font> As she was
      nowhere about she would surely be with Mrs.
      Grose, whom, in the comfort of that theory, I accordingly
      proceeded in quest of. <font color="mistyrose">I found her where I had found
        her the evening before,</font> but she met my quick challenge with blank,
      scared ignorance. She had only supposed that, after the repast, I had
      carried off both the children; as to which she was quite in her right, <font color="magenta">for it was the very first time I had allowed the
        little girl out of my sight </font> without some special provision. Of
      course now indeed she might be with the maids, so that the immediate thing
      was <font color="magenta">to look for her</font> without an air of
      alarm. This we promptly arranged between us; but when, <font color="Olive">ten minutes
        later</font> and in pursuance of our arrangement, we met in the hall, it
      was only to report on either side that after guarded inquiries we had
      altogether failed to trace her. For <font color="Olive">a minute</font> there, <font color="magenta">apart from observation,</font>
      <font color="sienna">we exchanged mute alarms,</font> and I could feel

    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>We went straight to the lake, as it was called at Bly, and I daresay rightly called, <font color="magenta">
        <font color="magenta">though I reflect that it may in fact

      </font> My acquaintance with sheets of water
      was small, and the pool of Bly, at all events on the few occasions of my consenting, under the
      protection of my pupils, to affront its surface in the old flat-bottomed
      boat moored there for our use, had impressed me both with its extent and its
      agitation. The usual place of embarkation was half a mile from the house,
      but I had an intimate conviction that, wherever Flora might be, she was not near home. She had not given me
      the slip for any small adventure, and, since the day of the very great one
      that I had shared with her by the pond, I had been aware, in our walks, of
      the quarter to which she most inclined. This was why I had now given to
      Mrs. Grose’s steps so marked <font color="mistyrose">a direction—a direction </font> that made her, <font color="magenta">when she perceived it, oppose a resistance that

      my friend cried, planted so firm that, taking it in, I went straight on
      without her. By the time I reached the pool, however, she was close behind
      me, and I knew that, whatever, to her apprehension, might befall me, the
      exposure of my society struck her as her least danger. <font color="sienna">She exhaled a moan of relief </font> as we at last
      <font color="magenta">came in sight of the greater part of the
        water without a sight of the child. </font>
      <font color="magenta">There was no trace of Flora on that nearer side of the bank where my
        observation of her had been most startling, and none on the opposite
        edge, where, save for a margin of some twenty yards, a thick copse came
        down to the water. </font> The pond, oblong in shape, had a width so
      scant compared to its length that, with its ends out of view it might have
      been taken for a scant river. <font color="magenta">We looked at the
        empty expanse, and then I felt the suggestion of my friend’s eyes.

      in a small refuge formed by one of the recesses of the pool, an indentation
      masked, for the hither side, by a projection of the bank and by a clump of
      trees growing close to the water.

    <div class="paragraph" n="18"><sup>¶18</sup>

        <font color="mistyrose">“Laws!”</font>
      </font> cried my friend again; the chain of my logic was ever too much for
      her. It dragged her at my heels even now, and when we had got halfway
      round—a devious, tiresome process, on ground much broken and by a path
      choked with overgrowth— <font color="lightpink">I paused to give her breath.</font>
      <font color="teal">I sustained her with a grateful arm,</font>
      assuring her that she might hugely help me; and this started us afresh, so
      that in the course of but few minutes more we reached a point from which we
      found the boat to be where I had supposed it. <font color="magenta">It
        had been intentionally left as much as possible out of sight </font> and
      was tied to one of the stakes of a fence that came, just there, down to the
      brink and that had been an assistance to disembarking. <font color="magenta">I recognized, as I looked at the pair of short,
      </font> thick oars, quite safely drawn up, the prodigious character of the
      feat for a little girl; but I had lived, by this time, too long among
      wonders and had panted to too many livelier measures. There was a gate in
      the fence, through which we passed, and that brought us, after a trifling
      interval, more into the open. Then, “There she is!” we both
      exclaimed at once.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="22"><sup>¶22</sup>Flora, a short way off, stood before us on
      the grass and smiled as if her performance was now complete. The next thing
      she did, however, was to stoop straight down and pluck—quite as if it were
      all she was there for—a big, ugly spray of withered fern. I instantly became
      sure she had just come out of the copse. She waited for us, not herself
      taking a step, and I was conscious of the rare solemnity with which we
      presently approached her. <font color="magenta">She smiled and
        smiled,</font> and we met; <font color="sienna">but it was all done
        in a silence by this time flagrantly ominous. </font>Mrs. Grose was the first to break the
      spell: she threw herself on her knees and, <font color="teal">drawing
        the child to her breast, clasped in a long embrace the little tender,
        yielding body. </font>
      <font color="magenta">While this dumb convulsion lasted I could only
        watch it—which I did the more intently when I saw Flora’s face peep at me over our companion’s shoulder.
      </font> It was serious now—the flicker had left it; but it strengthened the
      pang with which I at that moment envied Mrs.
      Grose the simplicity of <em>her </em>
      relation. Still, all this while, nothing more passed between us save that
      Flora had let her foolish fern again
      drop to the ground. <font color="Indigo">
        <font color="Green">What she and I had
          virtually said to each other was that pretexts were useless now.

        Grose finally got up she kept the child’s hand,</font> so
      that the two were still before me; and the singular reticence of our
      communion was even more marked <font color="magenta">in the frank look
        she launched me. </font>

      opposite bank exactly as she had stood the other time, and I remember,
      strangely, as the first feeling now produced in me, my thrill of joy at
      having brought on a proof. <font color="mistyrose">She was there, and I was
        justified; she was there, </font> and I was neither cruel nor mad. <font color="mistyrose">She was there for poor scared Mrs. Grose, but she was there most for Flora; </font> and no moment of my monstrous
      time was perhaps so extraordinary as that in which I consciously threw out
      to her—with the sense that, pale and ravenous demon as she was, <font color="teal">she would catch and understand it</font>—an
      inarticulate message of gratitude. She rose erect on the spot my friend and
      I had lately quitted, and there was not, <font color="teal">in all
        the long reach of her desire, an inch of her evil that fell short. </font>
      <font color="magenta">This first vividness of vision and emotion were
        things of <font color="Olive">a few secondsa</font>, during which Mrs. Grose’s dazed blink across to where I
        pointed struck me as a sovereign sign that she too at last saw, just as
        it carried my own eyes precipitately to the child. </font> The revelation
      then of the manner in which Flora was
      affected startled me, in truth, far more than it would have done to find her
      also merely agitated, for direct dismay was of course not what I had
      expected. Prepared and on her guard as our pursuit had actually made her,
      she would repress every betrayal; <font color="teal">and I was
        therefore shaken, </font> on the spot, <font color="magenta">by my
        first glimpse </font> of the particular one for which I had not allowed.
      <font color="magenta">To see her, without a convulsion of her small
        <font color="pink">pink</font> face,
      </font> not even feign to
      glance in the direction of the prodigy I announced, but only, instead of
      that, turn at <em>me</em>
      <font color="magenta">an expression of hard, still gravity, an
        expression absolutely new and unprecedented and that appeared to read
        and accuse and judge me </font> —this was a stroke that somehow converted
      the little girl herself into the very presence that could make me quail.
      <font color="magenta">I quailed even though my certitude that she
        thoroughly saw </font> was never greater than at that instant, and in the
      immediate need to defend myself I called it passionately to witness. <font color="Indigo">“She’s there, you little
        unhappy thing— <font color="mistyrose">there, there, <em>there</em>, and you see her as well as you see me!” </font>
      </font> I had said shortly before to Mrs.
      Grose that she was not at these times a child, but an old,
      old woman, and that description of her could not have been more strikingly
      confirmed than in the way in which, for all answer to this, <font color="magenta">she simply showed me, without a concession, an
        admission, of her eyes, a countenance of deeper and deeper, of indeed
        suddenly quite fixed, reprobation. </font> I was by this time—if I can
      put the whole thing at all together—more appalled at what I may properly
      call her manner than at anything else, though it was simultaneously with
      this that I became aware of having Mrs.
      Grose also, and very formidably, to reckon with. My elder
      companion, the next moment, at any rate, <font color="mistyrose">blotted out
        everything but her own flushed face</font>

      needed that, for with this hard blow of the proof that <font color="magenta">her

      crumble, I felt—<font color="magenta">I saw</font>—my livid predecessor

      of what I should have from this instant to deal with in the astounding
      little attitude of Flora. <font color="teal">Into this attitude Mrs.
        Grose immediately and violently entered, breaking, even

      </font>
      <font color="Periwinkle"><em>We</em> know, don’t we, love?” </font> —and she

        continued to fix me with her small mask of reprobation, </font> and even
      at <font color="Olive">that minute</font> I prayed God to forgive me for<font color="magenta">seeming to see that,</font> as she stood there <font color="teal">holding tight to our friend’s dress, </font> her
      incomparable childish beauty had suddenly failed, had quite vanished. I’ve

      which might have been that of a vulgarly pert little girl in the street, she
      <font color="teal">hugged Mrs.

      for my disaster as it was not there for my service. The wretched child had
      spoken exactly as if she had got from some outside source each of her
      stabbing little words, and I could therefore, in the full despair of all I
      had to accept, but sadly shake my head at her. <font color="Indigo">“If I had ever doubted, all my doubt would

      <font color="Indigo">“the easy and perfect
        way to meet it. I’ve done my best, but I’ve lost you. Goodbye.” </font>
      For Mrs. Grose I had an imperative, an
      almost frantic <font color="Indigo">
        <font color="mistyrose">“Go, go!”</font>
      </font> before which, in infinite distress, <font color="magenta">but

        her blindness, </font> that something awful had occurred and some
      collapse engulfed us, she retreated, by the way we had come, as fast as she
      could move.

    <div class="paragraph" n="9"><sup>¶9</sup>Of what first happened when I was left alone I had no subsequent memory. I
      only knew that at the end of, I suppose, a quarter of an hour, <font color="teal">an odorous dampness and roughness, chilling and
        piercing my trouble, had made me understand that I must have thrown
        myself, on my face, on the ground and given way to a wildness of grief.

        got up and looked a moment, through the twilight, </font> at the <font color="gray">gray pool</font> and its blank, haunted edge, and then
      I took, back to the house, my dreary and difficult course. When I reached
      the gate in the fence the boat, to my surprise, was gone, so that I had a
      fresh reflection to make on Flora’s
      extraordinary command of the situation. She passed that night, by the most
      tacit, and I should add, were not the word so grotesque a false note, the
      happiest of arrangements, with Mrs.

        <font color="mistyrose">I saw</font>
      </font> —I can use no other phrase—so much of him that it was as if it were
      more than it had ever been. No evening I had passed at Bly had the portentous quality of this one; <font color="mistyrose">in spite of which—and in spite also of </font> the deeper depths of
      consternation that had opened beneath my feet—there was literally, in the
      ebbing actual, an extraordinarily <font color="darkgreen">sweet
        sadness.</font> On reaching the house <font color="magenta">I had
        never so much as looked for the boy; </font> I had simply gone straight
      to my room to change what I was wearing and to take in, <font color="magenta">at a glance, </font> much material testimony to
      Flora’s rupture. Her little belongings
      had all been removed. <font color="maroon">When later, by the schoolroom fire,
      </font> I was served with tea by the usual maid, I indulged, on the article
      of my other pupil, in no inquiry whatever. He had his freedom now—<font color="mistyrose">he might have it to the end! Well, he did have it;
      </font> and it consisted—in part at least—of his coming in at <font color="Olive">about eight o’clock</font> and sitting down with me in
      silence. On the removal of the tea things <font color="maroon">I had blown out
        the candles </font> and drawn my chair closer: I was conscious of a
      mortal coldness and felt as if I should never again be warm. <font color="magenta">So, when he appeared, </font>
      <font color="maroon">I was sitting in the glow with my thoughts.</font> He paused
      a moment by the door <font color="magenta">as if to look at me; </font>
      then—as if to share them—<font color="maroon">came to the other side of the
        hearth</font> and sank into a chair. We sat there in absolute stillness;
      yet he wanted, I felt, to be with me.

        Grose, </font> who had come to my bedside with worse news.
      Flora was so markedly feverish that an
      illness was perhaps at hand; she had passed a <font color="Olive">night</font> of extreme
      unrest, a night agitated above all by fears that had for their subject not
      in the least her former, but wholly
      her present, governess. It was not
      against the possible re-entrance of Miss
      Jessel on the scene that she protested—it was conspicuously
      and passionately against mine. I was promptly on my feet of course, and with
      an immense deal to ask; the more that my friend had discernibly now girded
      her loins to meet me once more. This I felt as soon as I had put to her the
      question of her sense of the child’s sincerity as against my own. <font color="Indigo">“She persists in denying

    <h3>Chapter: 22</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>Yet it was when she had got off—and I missed her on the spot—<font color="teal">that the great pinch </font> really came. If I had
      counted on what it would give me to find myself alone with Miles, <font color="magenta">I speedily
        perceived, at least, that it would give me a measure. </font> No
      <font color="Olive">hour</font> of my stay in fact was so assailed with apprehensions
      as that of my coming down to learn that the carriage containing Mrs. Grose and my younger pupil had already
      rolled out of the gates. Now I <em> was</em>, I said to
      myself, face to face with the elements, and for much of the rest of
      <font color="GreenYellow">the day</font>, while I fought my weakness, I could consider that
      I had been supremely rash. It was a tighter place still than I had yet
      turned round in; all the more that, for the first time, <font color="magenta">I could see in the aspect of others a confused
        reflection of the crisis. </font>
      <font color="magenta">What had happened naturally caused them all to
        stare; </font> there was too little of the explained, throw out whatever
      we might, in the suddenness of my colleague’s act. <font color="magenta">The maids and the men looked blank;</font> the
      effect of which on my nerves was an aggravation <font color="magenta">until I saw the necessity of making it a positive aid.</font>
      <font color="teal">It was precisely, in short, by just clutching
        the helm that I avoided total wreck; </font> and I dare say that, to bear
      up at all, I became, that morning, very grand and very dry. I welcomed the
      consciousness that I was charged with much to do, and I caused it to be
      known as well that, left thus to myself, I was quite remarkably firm. I
      wandered with that manner, for <font color="Olive">the next hour</font> or two, all over
      the place and <font color="magenta"> looked, </font> I have no doubt, as
      if I were ready for any onset. So, for the benefit of whom it might concern,
      I paraded with a sick heart.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>The person it appeared least to concern proved to be, till dinner, little
      Miles himself. My perambulations had
      given me, meanwhile, <font color="magenta">no glimpse of him, </font>
      but they had tended to make more public the change taking place in our
      relation as a consequence of his having at the piano, <font color="GreenYellow">the day
        before</font>, kept me, in Flora’s
      interest, so beguiled and befooled. The stamp of publicity had of course
      been fully given by her confinement and departure, and the change itself was
      now ushered in by our nonobservance of the regular custom of the schoolroom.
      <font color="magenta">He had already disappeared when, on my way
        down, I pushed open his door, and I learned below that he had
        breakfasted—in the presence of a couple of the maids—with Mrs. Grose and his sister. </font> He had
      then gone out, as he said, for a stroll; than which nothing, I reflected,
      <font color="magenta"> could better have expressed his frank view
        of the abrupt transformation of my office. </font> What he would not
      permit this office to consist of was yet to be settled: there was a queer
      relief, at all events—I mean for myself in especial—in the renouncement of
      one pretension. If so much had sprung to the surface, I scarce put it too
      strongly in saying that what had perhaps <font color="mistyrose">sprung</font>
      highest was the absurdity of our prolonging the fiction that I had anything
      more to teach him. It sufficiently stuck out that, by tacit little tricks in
      which even more than myself he carried out the care for my dignity, I had
      had to appeal to him to let me off straining to meet him on the ground of
      his true capacity. He had at any rate his freedom now; <font color="teal">I was never to touch it again;</font>
      <font color="magenta">as I had amply shown,</font> moreover, when, on
      his joining me in the schoolroom the <font color="GreenYellow">previous
        <font color="Olive">night</font>
      </font>, I had uttered, on the subject of the interval
      just concluded, neither challenge nor hint. I had too much, from this
      moment, my other ideas. Yet when he at last arrived, the difficulty of
      applying them, the accumulations of my problem, were brought straight home
      to me by the beautiful little presence on which what had occurred had as
      yet, <font color="magenta">for the eye, dropped neither stain nor
        shadow.</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup>To mark, for the house, the high state I cultivated I decreed that my meals
      with the boy should be served, as we called it, downstairs; so that I had
      been awaiting him in the ponderous pomp of the room outside of the window of
      which I had had from Mrs. Grose, that
      first scared <font color="GreenYellow">Sunday</font>, <font color="magenta">my flash of
        something it would scarce have done to call light. </font> Here at
      present I felt afresh—for I had felt it <font color="mistyrose">again and
        again</font>seg&gt;—how my equilibrium depended on the success of my rigid
      <font color="mistyrose">will, the will</font>
      <font color="magenta">to shut my eyes as tight as possible to the
        truth</font> that what I had to deal with was, revoltingly, against
      nature. I could only get on at all by taking “nature” into my confidence and
      my account, by treating my monstrous ordeal <font color="teal">as a
        push in a direction unusual, </font> of course, and unpleasant, but
      demanding, after all, for a fair front, only another turn of the screw of
      ordinary human virtue. No attempt, nonetheless, could well require more tact
      than just this attempt to supply, one’s self, <em>all</em> the nature. How could I put even a little of that article
      into a suppression of reference to what had occurred? How, on the other
      hand, could I make <font color="mistyrose">reference</font> without a new
      plunge into the hideous obscure? Well, a sort of answer, after a time, had
      come to me, and it was so far confirmed as that I was met, incontestably,
      <font color="magenta">by the quickened vision </font> of what was
      rare in my little companion. It was indeed as if he had found even now—as he
      had so often <font color="mistyrose">found</font> at lessons—still some other
      delicate way to ease me off. Wasn’t there light in the fact which, as we
      shared our solitude, broke out with a specious glitter it had never yet
      quite worn?—the fact that (opportunity aiding, precious opportunity which
      had now come) it would be preposterous, with a child so endowed, to forego
      the help one might wrest from absolute intelligence? What had his
      intelligence been given him for but to save him? <font color="teal">Mightn’t one, to reach his mind, risk the stretch of an angular arm
        over his character? </font> It was as if, <font color="magenta">when
        we were face to face in the dining room, he had literally shown me the
        way. </font> The roast mutton was on the table, and I had dispensed with
      attendance. Miles, before he sat down,
      stood a moment with his hands in his pockets and looked at the joint, on
      which he seemed on the point of passing some humorous judgment. But what he
      presently produced was: <font color="Goldenrod">“I
        say, my dear, is she really very awfully ill?” </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="4"><sup>¶4</sup>

      from <font color="GreenYellow">the day</font> of his arrival, had relieved me of all grossness
      of admonition. Whatever he had been driven from school for, it was not for
      ugly feeding. He was irreproachable, as always, <font color="GreenYellow">today</font>; but he
      was unmistakably more conscious. He was discernibly trying to take for
      granted more things than he found, without assistance, quite easy; <font color="sienna">and he dropped into peaceful silence</font>, while
      he felt his situation. Our meal was of the briefest—mine a vain pretense,

      pockets and his back to me—stood <font color="magenta">and looked out

      </font> On this, however, <font color="magenta">he faced to the window
        again</font> and <font color="teal"> presently reached it with
        his vague, restless, cogitating step. </font> He remained there awhile,
      with his forehead against the glass, in contemplation of the stupid shrubs I
      knew and the dull things of <font color="GreenYellow">November</font>. I had always
      my hypocrisy of “work,” behind which, now, I gained the sofa. Steadying
      myself with it there as I had repeatedly done at those moments of torment
      that I have described as the moments of my knowing the children to be given
      to something from which I was barred, I sufficiently obeyed my habit of
      being prepared for the worst. But an extraordinary impression dropped on me
      as I extracted a meaning from the boy’s embarrassed back—none other than the
      impression that I was not barred now. This inference grew in a <font color="Olive">few
        minutes</font> to sharp intensity and seemed bound up with the direct
      perception that it was positively <em>he </em> who was.
      <font color="magenta">The frames and squares of the great window
        were a kind of image, </font> for him, of a kind of failure. <font color="magenta">I felt that I saw him,</font> at any rate, shut in
      or shut out. He was admirable, but not comfortable: I took it in with a
      throb of hope. <font color="magenta">Wasn’t he looking, through the
        haunted pane, for something he couldn’t see?</font>—and wasn’t it the
      first time in the whole business that he had known such a lapse? <font color="mistyrose">The first, the very first:</font> I found it a splendid
      portent. <font color="magenta">It made him anxious, though he watched
        himself; </font> he had been anxious <font color="GreenYellow">all day</font> and, <font color="darkgreen">even while in his usual sweet little manner
      </font> he sat at table, had needed all his small strange genius <font color="lime">to give it a gloss.</font> When he at last turned round to
      meet me, it was almost as if this genius had succumbed. <font color="Goldenrod">“Well, I think I’m glad Bly<font color="mistyrose">agrees with <em>me!</em>”

      in <em>any</em> way was an act of violence, for what did
      it consist of but the obtrusion of the idea of grossness and guilt on a
      small helpless creature who had been for me a revelation of the

    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>My sense of how he received this suffered for <font color="Olive">a minute</font> from
      something that I can describe only <font color="teal">as a fierce
        split of my attention—a stroke that at first, as I sprang straight up,
        reduced me to the mere blind movement of getting hold of him, drawing
        him close, </font> and, while I just fell for support against the nearest
      piece of furniture, instinctively keeping him with his back to the window.
      The appearance was full upon us that I had already had to deal with here:
      <font color="magenta">Peter
        Quint had come into view like a sentinel before a prison.
        The next thing I saw was that, from outside, he had reached the window,
        and then I knew that, close to the glass and glaring in through it, he
        offered once more to the room his white
        face of damnation. </font>
      <font color="magenta">It represents but grossly what took place within
        me at the sight to say </font> that on the second my decision was made;
      yet I believe that no woman so overwhelmed ever in so short a time recovered
      her grasp of the <em>act</em>. It came to me in the very
      horror of the immediate presence that the act would be, <font color="magenta">
        <font color="mistyrose">seeing and facing what I saw and faced, </font>
      </font> to keep the boy himself unaware. The inspiration—I can call it by no
      other name—was that I felt how voluntarily, how transcendently, I <em>might</em>. <font color="teal">It was like
        fighting with a demon for a human soul, </font> and when I had fairly so

      <font color="teal">in the tremor of my hands, at arm’s

      <font color="sienna">and out of it presently came a sound, not low nor
        weak,</font> but as if from much further away, <font color="Peru">

      My present quickened courage, however, was such that, not too much to let it
      through, <font color="maroon">I had to shade, as it were, my flame. </font>
      <font color="magenta">Meanwhile the glare of the face was again at the
        window, the scoundrel fixed as if to watch and wait. </font> It was the

      It was for the instant confounding and bottomless, for if he <em>were </em> innocent, what then on earth was <em>I?</em> Paralyzed, while it lasted, by the mere brush

Somehow—not exactly sure how—I managed to forget how incredibly rich this text is and this is not even to mention the rich secondary criticism produced by this short little novella. Inspired—once again—by some posts from Jonathan Reeve over at Columbia (specifically, his nice <a href="https://jonreeve.com/2017/06/henry-james-sentence/">write-up</a> about sentence lengths in James along with his <a href="https://jonreeve.com/2016/01/non-linear-garden-party/">encoded .xml version</a> of Katherine Mansfield&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Garden Party&rdquo;), I figured I could spend a little bit of time encoding James&rsquo;s story. An early version of the text with all the necessary TEI nuts and bolts is available <a href="https://jonreeve.com/2016/01/non-linear-garden-party/">here</a>. I still need to beautify and format things a bit, but, as I say, the skeleton is there for anyone that might want to <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/henry_james">fork and utilize it</a> for further annotations. I should also say that Kate Singer&rsquo;s really wonderful <a href="https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/digital-close-reading-tei-for-teaching-poetic-vocabularies/">essay</a>, &ldquo;Digital Close Reading: TEI for Teaching Poetic Vocabularies,&rdquo; in <em>The Journal of Interactive Technology &amp; Pedagogy</em>, has served as further inspiration. Her and her students&rsquo; use of the <code>&lt;seg ana&gt;</code> <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-seg.html">TEI tag</a> to include semantic/analytical tags was incredibly useful as my encoding was interested in trying to keep track of the story&rsquo;s clear obsession with sight and vision (there are tags related to the use of the five senses in both figurative and literal/physical form)—an obsession that Shoshana Felman&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2930436?seq=1">canonical essay</a>, &ldquo;Turning the Screw of Interpretation,&rdquo; did yeoman&rsquo;s work charting out for all of us who came after.</p>
<p>There is still much more to be added here—most of the time so far was spent on getting all the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags set up with chapters and paragraphs properly tagged and enumerated—along with properly tagging all the dialogue. In a really haphazard way I tried to attend to some of the semantic annotations I wanted to get into the encoding, but, as I say, it&rsquo;s really haphazard and not at all really standardized and extensive or complete. I should mention, with regards to the dialogue, that it was fun to be able to actually <em>encode</em> how profoundly ambiguous so much of the dialogue is—especially in the prologue. I have <code>&lt;said&gt;</code> tags in the text where it&rsquo;s not clear to me at all precisely who is speaking. We know there are multiple women that pose questions to Douglas in the &ldquo;Prologue,&rdquo; but James does not attribute them nor does he name some of the women (Mrs. Griffin gets named, but the other women do not). For some reason that I can&rsquo;t quite totally explain, I find it really fascinating how this whole process can very explicitly <em>(en)code the ambiguity in the text</em> in this way that is, ironically, quite clear and &ldquo;easy to see&rdquo; (I use that last phrase very guardedly in this context, obviously). We all know this is one of the key techniques in James&rsquo;s production of a sense of uncanniness in the story, but, again, it is indeed intriguing to be able to encode this technique in an explicit way.</p>
<p>Seasoned readers within psychoanalysis and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny">Freud&rsquo;s work</a> are also very aware of the power of repetition within the production of <a href="https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/freud1.pdf">&ldquo;uncanniness&rdquo;</a>. I also tried to keep track of many of the semantic instances of &ldquo;repetition&rdquo; (with the <code>&lt;seg ana='repetition'&gt;</code> tag) along with other forms (i.e. when one characters &ldquo;echoes&rdquo; the words of another or just brutally repeats their interlocutor&rsquo;s words back to them, a rather frequent little tic that arises between the governess and Mrs. Grose). I also tried to play around a little bit with actually counting the number of repeated words within the text as a whole (the script for that is in the aforementioned repo, direct link <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/henry_james/blob/main/main_james_script.py">here</a>). There are functions in that script to count repeated lemmas within a bunch of different &ldquo;ranges&rdquo;—so, one can figure out how often a particular lemma is repeated within five or ten or fifty or one-hundred tokens, thus giving one a sense of how often characters are repeating an individual lemma (not to mention the number of times such repetitions occur within the governess&rsquo; narrative—as a side note, it would be curious to see if most of the repetitions occur <em>within</em> dialogue tags or if a good deal of them happen in the governess&rsquo; non-dialogue-narrative, my sense is that most of the repetitions do occur within dialogue, though I haven&rsquo;t checked or verified that—although now that the text has all the dialogue tagged, this process should be a pretty simple of parsing the .xml tree).</p>
<p>I am not sure that there is anything profoundly new that has surfaced through/from this process—although it has definitely given me a new lens through which to read and think about this story. All the elements mentioned so far are ones that are quite legible just from a normal/traditional close reading of the text; that said, it gives another way to see things, which I find quite fascinating. I am enthusiastic about seeing what one might want to add in terms of the annotation tags. I plan to fleshing out more of the tags associated with the senses, vision, touch, etc. (one should not skimp on the mentions of things having to do with touch—both literally/physically and in a figurative way—as there are numerous instances where the governess &ldquo;takes hold of&rdquo; someone physically [Mrs. Grose quite often, in fact]). The sense of touch is quite significant (I&rsquo;m sure someone in the secondary criticism has covered this, so I&rsquo;m hesitant to claim any originality here whatsoever) within this story.</p>
<p>More work with regards to some of the counting of repetitions—perhaps something including a use of the whole ngram tools—could allow for further thinking about precisely how we might want to count these syntactic/linguistic repetitions.</p>
<p>More to come, to be sure.</p>

<p>His video laying out the steps for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPgQH5UTC9k">&ldquo;Binary Data Classification&rdquo;</a> was clear and quite clarifying for me in all kinds of ways. The classifier&rsquo;s job in this video was to see if it could tell the difference between the work of Oscar Wilde and Dan Brown. What if we tried a different pair of authors/texts? As I offhandedly mentioned in my previous <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-03-29-vector-space-models-and-shakespeare/">post</a>, finding texts in the public domain (like Shakespeare&rsquo;s for example), saves one quite a bit of time wrangling things together. I also, for some, reason, have found myself going back to some of the works of Willa Cather (admittedly, she&rsquo;s definitely not in my wheelhouse/field of study by any stretch of the imagination) and was wondering how a machine learning classifier might perform when looking at Cather&rsquo;s texts alongside those of one of her key influences, Sarah Orne Jewett (image below is courtesy of UNL&rsquo;s fantastic <em>Willa Cather Archive</em> <a href="https://cather.unl.edu/writings/books/0017">here</a>):</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_10/o_pioneers_1913_dedication_to_jewett.png" alt="Cather Dedication to Jewett 1913"></p>
<p>Why not?—I figured I could tinker around a bit to see what&rsquo;s possible. Project Gutenberg has a number of texts by both <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/22">Cather</a> and <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/202">Jewett</a>—and the UNL <em>Willa Cather Archive</em> has a good number of her texts <a href="https://cather.unl.edu/writings/books">formatted in .xml</a>. I grabbed as many of the texts as I could from these two sources. Since the Gutenberg texts come with the typical boilerplate material at the start and end of the plain text file I pulled out a nice little script from <a href="https://github.com/c-w/gutenberg">&ldquo;C-W&rdquo; on GitHub</a> that had a nice list of phrases used in the boilerplate material; <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/authorship_attribution_studies/blob/main/cather_jewett/strip_headers_and_footers.py">the simple script</a> would strip all the boilerplate when the text files get read in.</p>
<p>The major steps here for this tinkering is to read in all the plain text files, split everything up by sentences, write a function that will &ldquo;pad&rdquo; the data so that any sentences that are less than a specific length ultimately get a <code>?</code> added to the sentence to bring it&rsquo;s length up to the already specified <code>max_length</code> of each sentence. This is due to the way that the keras library likes to have data fed to it. That function looks as follows:</p>

I quite enjoy her <a href="https://cather.unl.edu/writings/shortfiction/ss006">short story</a>, &ldquo;Paul&rsquo;s Case: A Study in Temperament.&rdquo; The script will read in the text, utilize the <code>word_index.json</code> file to replace each word with the number of that word in the index. One can then keep track of each sentence to see the model&rsquo;s predictions: a score close to <code>0</code> suggests the model thinks it&rsquo;s by Cather; the closer to <code>1</code>, the prediction is that it belongs to Jewett. (The full test log <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/authorship_attribution_studies/blob/main/cather_jewett/logging_predictions/test_log_file.txt">file</a> from the console is available here.)

<p>Most of the sentences are predicted to be by Cather. Curiously, feeding the model a text by Jewett, &ldquo;A Mate of the Daylight,&rdquo; most of the predictions are towards the Cather side of the graph:</p>

<p>It would no doubt be good to do a little bit of digging here to see what might be going on with the model&rsquo;s predictions about this Jewett story. Also, hopefully, in the near future, I can do a little bit of writing about some of the other classifiers one could build and set to work on these Cather and Jewett texts.</p>

<p>Much of the toe-dipping into this new DH field I&rsquo;ve been doing as of late has centered around learning many of the kinds of projects carried out and then turning the methods within those projects onto mew artifacts. A while back I worked my way through Folgert Karsdorp, Mike Kestemont, and Allen Riddell&rsquo;s <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691172361/humanities-data-analysis"><em>Humanities Data Analysis: Case Studies with Python</em></a>. I found a great deal of it thought-provoking and fascinating—especially the chapters devoted to modeling texts with vector spaces and the later chapter on stylometry, which focused on some texts by Hildegard of Bingen and Bernard of Clairvaux. With regards to the first vector space angle, a good deal of very old and dusty linear algebra from my undergraduate days has been rattling around in my head as of late—and it was quite fun to see if I could get any of the old gears turning again (some I definitely could, others will need a bit more grease to get things moving once more).</p>
<p>Chapter 3 of <em>Humanities Data Analysis</em> focused on visually &ldquo;mapping&rdquo; a number of different genres of plays from classical French theater, utilizing some vector space math. I wondered what things would look like if we turned these methods on some of Shakespeare&rsquo;s works. All the plays Karsdorp, et. al. were working with were in .xml format—and after learning how much time the data analyst working on just getting data into a form and structure (&ldquo;preprocessing&rdquo; that is ready for analytic work in the first place, it seemed easy enough to simply grab the bard&rsquo;s texts from <em>The Folger Shakespeare</em>, especially since one can get them all in <a href="https://tei-c.org/tag/tei-simple/">TEI Simple</a> <a href="https://shakespeare.folger.edu/download-the-folger-shakespeare-complete-set/">.xml format</a>—which makes all the plays incredibly easy to parse since all the work of encoding has been done for one already. As most readers of Shakespeare know, his work has often been carved up into similar genres categories to the one&rsquo;s Karsdorp, et. al. were using on their French theater corpus—i.e. into comedies, tragedies, tragicomedy, etc. So I figured I could try something similar with this different corpus.</p>
<p>After grabbing the TEI texts from Folger, we could get some libraries imported and then create some lists with genres and the plays that belong to those genres (it&rsquo;s a little rough, but I simply used the age-old &ldquo;comedy/history/tragedy/late romance&rdquo; categories).</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Karsdorp, et. al., following <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13019">Schöch</a>, use a couple of French words (<em>monsieur</em> and <em>sang</em>) that are thought to have &ldquo;considerable discriminative power for these genres.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> When we call the two functions above on our <code>plays</code> list, we get: <code>document term matrix with |D| = 37 documents and |V| = 15733 words.</code></p>
<p>With all of this in a numpy array, it&rsquo;s simple enough to look up a word in the matrix, find it&rsquo;s index, and then see how all of the plays/genres use that word. What if we used the English &ldquo;blood&rdquo; and &ldquo;love&rdquo; to map out all of the plays/genres? We&rsquo;d get something like the following:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_9/Figure_1.png" alt="blood and love in Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s plays"></p>
<p>We could substitute any other word we like and then see how &ldquo;close&rdquo; together the plays are when focusing on the two words of our choosing—here&rsquo;s &ldquo;love&rdquo; and &ldquo;hate&rdquo; on the X and Y axis respectively (the <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/humanities_data_analysis">repo</a> for all of this also has functions that will allow one to use different <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/02/4-types-of-distance-metrics-in-machine-learning/">&ldquo;distance metrics&rdquo;</a> with which to define and quantify the &ldquo;closeness&rdquo; or &ldquo;similarity&rsquo; between any two plays or between different genres&rdquo;):</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_9/Figure_2.png" alt="love and hate"></p>
<p>We could also wonder a bit about how the genres themselves get arranged—simple enough:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_9/Figure_3.png" alt="genre distances based on frequency of &amp;ldquo;love&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;hate&amp;rdquo;"></p>
<p>I suppose what I&rsquo;ve found most useful here is not so much any profound insights into the bard&rsquo;s works (it&rsquo;s great to find other (computation/visual/digital) ways into his texts—and often for me that can function as a nice result in and of itself, but, instead, this &ldquo;computational&rdquo; way of thinking about things that is no doubt still really new and foreign to my strictly humanities-oriented background and training. It&rsquo;s incredibly simple, but learning how to get all of these plays into a nice, structured format that one can then write a couple of rather simple functions to then produce visualizations of the data that are another avenue into the original texts is really fantastic. Not to mention the fact that one could then take these very simple functions/calculations and utilize them in different situations—say, for example, using them in a machine learning algorithm for authorship attribution or in larger projects within the realm of stylometry, etc.—has made all this new knowledge and all these new skills incredibly generative. (With regards to Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;late romances&rdquo;—my mentor in graduate school just called them tragicomedies—I could imagine grabbing a bunch of texts by playwrights that would follow in the wake of Shakespeare: I have only recently come across the <a href="https://earlyprint.org/">&ldquo;EarlyPrint&rdquo;</a> website, which I know has a number of plays by Beaumont and Fletcher. It would be curious to see how close or far away those texts are from some of the plays within the &ldquo;late romances&rdquo; list above &hellip; )</p>
<p>As usual, more to come, for sure.</p>

The goal was to see if we could write some code to properly detect whether or not a tweet was viral (using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm">K-Nearest Neighbors</a> algorithm). I also played around with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a> model as well. All the code for the following is available in this <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/twitter_classification_codecademy_project">repo</a>. I then took all this dabbling and turned the algorithms on some different datasets of a much more &ldquo;literary&rdquo; kind. (Another post is still to come on seeing how well the algorithms might be able to distinguish between Willa Cather and one of her key predecessors, Sarah Orne Jewett.)</p>
<p>So, first things first, we&rsquo;re importing the necessary libraries for this task:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">import</span> matplotlib.pyplot <span style="color:#66d9ef">as</span> plt

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After reading in all the Twitter data from a .json file, we needed to think a little bit about how exactly we might want to define a &ldquo;viral tweet&rdquo;? Base it solely on the number of retweets, on the number of likes, on the number of favorites? The parameters for the original task suggested we might start with the median number of retweets for each tweet (I also had a look at the <code>favorite_count</code> as well to see what the minimum, maximum, median, and mean numbers looked like):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>retweet_counts <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> viral_tweets[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;retweet_count&#39;</span>]

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Graphing these values we get the following: <img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_8/Figure_1_summary_statistics.png" alt="Mean and Median Values">
The first time around here I just went with the median value as the cutoff for a &ldquo;viral tweet,&rdquo; so any row in the pandas dataframe that had more than the median number in a row, a new <code>is_viral</code> column got created and the row coded with <code>1</code> if it met the threshold and a <code>0</code> otherwise:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>viral_tweets[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;is_viral&#39;</span>] <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> viral_tweets[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;retweet_count&#39;</span>]<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>apply(<span style="color:#66d9ef">lambda</span> x: <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> median_retweet_count <span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next we started having a look at some of the other columns to see which ones might be helpful in predicting if a tweet would meet the median value threshold. Taking a look at the <code>tweet_length</code>, along with the numbers of followers and friends that a Twitter user had, we grabbed this data:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>viral_tweets[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;tweet_length&#39;</span>] <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> viral_tweets<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>apply(<span style="color:#66d9ef">lambda</span> x: len(x[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;text&#39;</span>]), axis<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>)

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next we separated out the <code>is_viral</code> as that will contain the label of each tweet (<code>1</code> for viral, otherwise <code>0</code>). Next we dropped all the columns from the dataframe that we weren&rsquo;t planning on using and just keeping the following list of columns: <code>['tweet_length', 'followers_count', 'friends_count']</code>. We scaled the data, getting us ready to start separating out the training and testing data and then training and fitting the classifier/model to the training data.</p>
<p>As per usual, we used the <code>train_test_split</code> function from <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html">sklearn&rsquo;s</a> library:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>train_data, test_data, train_labels, test_labels <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> train_test_split(scaled_df, labels, test_size <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0.2</span>, random_state <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>classifier <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>)

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(classifier<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>score(test_data, test_labels))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next we wrote a short little loop to keep track of the classifier&rsquo;s scores on the testing data using a different number of &ldquo;clusters&rdquo; (neighbors) ranging from <code>1</code> all the way up to <code>200</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>scores <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> []

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>plt<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>legend([<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;features: tweet length, # of followers, # of friends&#39;</span>])
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>along with a graph:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_8/Figure_2_first_run_of_scores_01.png" alt="First Run of Accuracy Scores Graph"></p>
<p>So we can see the roughly effectiveness of the classifier&rsquo;s ability to detect a viral tweet (based only on the data in the <code>'tweet_length', 'followers_count',</code> and <code>'friends_count'</code> columns) hovering around 60% or so. There&rsquo;s a steady drop off once the numbers of clusters gets to around 75.</p>
<p>The project then wondered if there were other features within the dataset that we could use to increase the model&rsquo;s predictive effectiveness. For this next round I added the <code>'number_of_hashtags'</code> to see what results that might produce. We then added that column and retrained the classifier:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>hashtag_col_added <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> [<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;tweet_length&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;followers_count&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;friends_count&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;number_of_hashtags&#39;</span>]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>hashtag_df <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> viral_tweets[hashtag_col_added]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>scaled_hashtag_df <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> scale(hashtag_df, axis<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>)

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>classifier<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>fit(h_train_data, h_train_labels)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(classifier<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>score(h_test_data, h_test_labels))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Scores taking the hashtags into account were as follows:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_8/hashtag_added.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A model with the <code>'tweet_length_alone'</code>:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_8/tweet_length_alone.png" alt="Tweet Length Alone"></p>
<p>It was intriguing to continue to add features to the classifier to see what the results would be—it was easy enough to thus train multiple models (with different numbers of features) and graph their effectiveness. I tried models where we added <code>'favorite_count'</code>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_8/tweet_length_friends_count_favorite_count.png" alt="Multiple Models"></p>
<p>Curiously, the model with the most features in it performed far less well than the ones with fewer:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_8/four_models.png" alt="Four Models"></p>
<p>One of the suggestions in the project asked one to wonder a bit about the threshold we used to define a &ldquo;viral tweet.&rdquo; We started with the median for the number of retweets a tweet in the dataset received. That number, 13, what if we tinkered a bit with that number? The mean for the <code>'retweet_count'</code> was much higher. Would the classifier before any better if we set the threshold at the mean? Easy enough to have a look-see. Rerunning the script with the mean as the threshold, again splitting the dataset, training the models, and then plotting some scores, we get a considerable increase in accuracy: <img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_8/four_models_with_mean_as_threshold.png" alt="Using the Mean as the &amp;ldquo;Viral Tweet&amp;rdquo; Threshold"> All of these models—with varying numbers of features used—performed much better; all four of them level-out right around 86% accuracy, with the model utilizing &ldquo;tweet_length, # of followers, # of friends, and # of hashtags&rdquo; performing best amongst the four.</p>
<p>Super-fun stuff—to be sure.</p>

Thinking it might be fun to dabble a little bit in some very basic sentiment analysis, I was curious to see what the main Twitter accounts for these five Chicagoland &ldquo;peer institution&rdquo; universities might look like—thus, I wrangled some data (using the <a href="https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape">snscrape</a> library) to see what there was to see. Would one be correct to assume that Twitter accounts for these universities would slide largely in the &ldquo;positive&rdquo; sentiment direction?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s start with <a href="https://twitter.com/uofstfrancis">USF</a>:</p>
<figure><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_7/usf_sentiment_results_pie_chart.png" width="425" height="auto"/>
</figure>

<p>Running all of the university&rsquo;s tweets through the <a href="https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/quickstart.html">TextBlob</a> python library, it shows the USF Twitter account to be pretty positive. Results for the rest of the schools is pretty similar:</p>

</figure>

<figure><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_7/sx_sentiment_results_pie_chart.png" width="425" height="auto"/>
</figure>

<p>And what about some visuals of sentiment over time? Here&rsquo;s an image of TextBlob&rsquo;s analysis of the &ldquo;polarity&rdquo; and &ldquo;subjectivity&rdquo; scores for each and every USF tweet, ever:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_7/usf_sentiment_scores_all_time.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There is quite a bit of data here one could dig into a bit more deeply. What do like and retweet counts look like for some of the school accounts (and how about coding the graphs with the school colors?)—especially over the lifespan of the account? Here&rsquo;s one for Lewis:</p>

<p>What about using the <a href="https://bokeh.org/">Bokeh library</a> to add some little &ldquo;hovertools&rdquo; that would link each point on the graph to each individual tweet?</p>

As Department Chair, a good deal of the Assessment Reports each year fall to me. Historically, for the past couple of years I have been more than content to simply just keep all of the scores on our assessed outcomes in one gigantic Excel spreadsheet. This thing certainly kept and held all the numerical data, but it was a bit of a monstrosity—and as the years went by and all the different kinds of courses and kinds of products our students produced to meet all these outcomes increased and multiplied, it became a little unwieldy.</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_6/excel_worksheet_clutter.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The file expanded and expanded with all of these tabs, all these extra worksheets, where I tried to keep track of all of these different kinds of things. There is no doubt whatsoever that all of it makes perfect sense to me—I thought I had some sense of where everything was, which cells linked to which other cells on other sheets, so on and so forth. But as time went on I think a lot of these connections became a little frayed to me and I started to wonder if the web here was all that legible. And then the thought of whether or not all these sheets would be legible to someone other than me was icing on the cake. (I kept thinking of those passages from Henri Bergson&rsquo;s <a href="https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Bergson/Bergson_1911a/Bergson_1911_03.html"><em>Creative Evolution</em></a> where he goes at the age-old philosophical distinction between &ldquo;order&rdquo; and &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; by thinking about the moment when one enters my incredibly &ldquo;messy room&rdquo; and declares it disordered. For me, there&rsquo;s nothing &ldquo;disordered&rdquo; about the room; everything makes perfect sense to me, the clothes are where they are because I threw them there, the bookshelves are stacked three levels deep for all kinds of good reasons—and besides, I know exactly where the Nietzsche section is, I&rsquo;m good with Kierkegaard, and goodness knows I&rsquo;d never forget where the Freud and Lacan are in all this &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; and chaos.)</p>
<p>And then, after doing a bunch of work making my way through Codecademy&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-analyst">data analytics path</a>, I came across Jean-Nicholas Hould&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.jeannicholashould.com/tidy-data-in-python.html">&ldquo;Tidy Data in Python&rdquo;</a> post from a number of years ago now and it was quite a Eureka! moment for me, in so many ways. Again, granted, a Eureka! moment for a total data science neophyte was nothing short of an absolutely inchoate banality for the expert, but none of this lessens the power all this new learning has had for me as of late. Yup, my departmental numbers were in an incredibly &ldquo;messy dataset&rdquo; as <a href="https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf">Hadley Wickham</a> and Hould describe it. So, as the deadline for annual departmental assessment reports rolled around I spent some time tidying up this rather messy dataset. I moved things around with newly-acquired data wrangling skills and got things into a form and structure that followed Wickham&rsquo;s suggestions—as Hould writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Each variable forms a column and contains values</li>
<li>Each observation forms a row</li>
<li>Each type of observational unit forms a table</li>
</ul>

<p>Six years of data—all in one simple CSV file—no more jumping between worksheets in one big file, no more leaping from sheet to sheet to generate graphs or to calculate even the most basic of summary statistics. Again, very far from high-powered machine learning models, K-means clustering, and all of that—just simple data tidying that even the most rudimentary knowledge of the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas library</a> in Python can start to work on quite nicely, quickly, and simply. Nothing fancy, just a nice clean .csv file:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_6/simple_csv_file.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With all that in place it was just a simple hop, skip, and a jump to some simple visualizations of the data:</p>

<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_6/Figure_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_6/Figure_3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Again, nothing fancy, but just a whole lot easier to work with everything when it&rsquo;s nice and &ldquo;tidy.&rdquo; Working with and querying the data became so much simpler—a line of code here and there and I could get information about averages—both current and historical—, information on student performance based on instructor, performance on individual outcomes, and so much more. And all because the data was cleaned up. Not to mention that with the structure in place going forward adding to the dataset becomes even simpler as well.</p>
<p>The repo with simple scripts for all this dummy data along with the visualizations is <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/solo_projects/tree/main/blog_post_projects/departmental_reports">here</a>.</p>

One of his posts from earlier this year, <a href="https://jonreeve.com/2021/05/rethinking-mla-papers/">&ldquo;Rethinking the MLA Style Research Paper&rdquo;</a> was incredibly generative for me—and it nicely dovetailed with some work my Departmental colleagues have been doing on thinking about writing at our university (a project generously funded by the <a href="https://www.avdf.org/">Arthur Vining Davis Foundation</a>). In addition, I&rsquo;ve been spending a good deal of time with Scott Selisker&rsquo;s wonderful <a href="http://u.arizona.edu/~selisker/post/workflow/">post</a> about the use of plain text writing in academic workflows—I&rsquo;ve learned how to incorporate <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> and even used Selisker&rsquo;s workflow suggestions to compose my department&rsquo;s assessment report from last year. I think it&rsquo;s just a tad bit frightening to think about how I did things before all this new knowledge. There is an enormous power to working either with plain text or writing everything in <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a> and then converting said text into all kinds of different formats via Pandoc. This is not even to mention the ways in which this workflow makes it incredibly easy to incorporate code into the writing—which, of course, prior to very recently, I never had anything to do with—now I feel as if I&rsquo;ve got a vast new area of knowledge to explore and discover. Terribly exciting and exhilarating.</p>
<p>Here in this post what I&rsquo;m hoping to do—admittedly incredibly modest—is combine Reeve&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/JonathanReeve/template-research-paper">repository</a> for the aforementioned &ldquo;Rethinking&rdquo; post along with utilizing the .css from <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">Dave Liepmann</a>, which attempts to fashion a style derived from the work of <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi">Edward Tufte</a>, especially the really fantastic stuff found in his <em>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em>. We&rsquo;ll see how it goes!</p>
<p>I should also mention a couple of the other places that were helpful:</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Sustainable Authorship in Plain Text using Pandoc and Markdown&rdquo; by Dennis Tenen and Grant Wythoff over at the <a href="https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown">Programming Historian</a> was a really nice start for me. I haven&rsquo;t gotten a chance to go through Tenen&rsquo;s <em>Plain Text: The Poetics of Composition</em> yet, but I am looking forward to that.</li>
<li>Mort Yao&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.soimort.org/notes/161117/">&ldquo;Boilerplating Pandoc for Academic Writing&rdquo;</a> was also very  useful as I was futzing around with using Pandoc to convert my assessment report from Markdown into .pdf format.</li>

<p>So, this last semester I did another &ldquo;Introduction to Literature&rdquo; course (as I so often do)—this time around I decided to set the theme around that of &ldquo;weird fiction.&rdquo; Since the <a href="https://dhsouthbend.org/dhri/">South Bend DHRI</a> last May I have been thinking a great deal about this whole &ldquo;data visualization&rdquo; thing. I wanted to find some way to visually represent the stories in the anthology that students were gravitating to from week to week. I gave minimal guidance—some weeks I would point out that one of my favorite stories was up on the docket or I tried to link the week&rsquo;s discussion to concerns or interests that students had shown in previous weeks. (This was just the old &ldquo;If you liked Julio Cortazar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Axolotl,&rdquo; be sure to read <em>X</em> &hellip;&rdquo;) There had to be an easy way to represent visually all the student interactions.</p>
<p>Not being an expert, I had to stumble around stupidly and idiotically. Starting with something as silly as a Venn Diagram drawn up in Microsoft Word—hoping to keep track of the kinds of connections students were making to the readings:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_4/figure_2_week_1_discussion_board_venn_diagram.png" alt=""></p>
<p>1st Iteration: just trying to draw the discussion board that week (I have whited-out student names)</p>
<p>Of course, I was first just trying to figure out how to simply draw the connections and not worry so much about the <em>how</em> or the kind of connections being made:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_4/figure_3_week_2_posts_by_story.png" alt=""></p>
<p>2nd Iteration: now simply logging the number of posts about each particular story</p>
<p>Heck—I could draw it by hand, but I wanted to be able to do it not just each week but also be able to produce a graph that would visualize the entire sixteen-week seminar.</p>
<p>And then I came across a tool (IIRC, I found a couple of tutorials on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk_jmmkw5S2BqnYBqF2VNPcszY93-ze49">jengolbeck</a>), a tool called <a href="https://gephi.org/"><em>Gephi</em></a> that would allow me to do exactly what I wanted—and quite a bit more, actually. I could take all of the students, myself, and all the texts that we would read, get them into a simple .csv file and then each week I could manually code the connections each individual student was making to the possible texts up for discussion (and also log the times students responded to me or to each other).</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_4/figure_4_gephi.png" alt="">
<img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_4/figure_5_gephi.png" alt="">
<img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_4/figure_6_gephi.png" alt="">
<img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_4/figure_7_gephi.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These are just some of the visualizations I played with over the course of the semester (all the green dots are students, the blue dot is me, and all the red ones are stories we read and that students discussed; the size of the nodes are determined by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(graph_theory)">&ldquo;degree&rdquo;</a> of the node). The big red node in the graph in the upper left was the most talked about story out of the entire anthology, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonora_Carrington">Leonora Carrington</a>&rsquo;s 1941 absurdist little tale, &ldquo;White Rabbits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tool also gives one some rather basic graph theory and simple statistical information as well. It is easy to have the computer count up the connections, making it rather simple to figure out the most popular texts over the course of the seminar:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_4/figure_10_most_popular.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It was also really simple to see which stories students did not talk about at all (the group in the upper right are all the texts no one mentioned):</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_4/figure_9_gephi.png" alt="A Final Graph"></p>
<p>Obviously, there are all kinds of ways to make this data slightly &ldquo;richer.&rdquo; After a week or two I noticed that I did want to get back to the &ldquo;kinds&rdquo; of connections students were making to the texts. Thus, Gephi makes it easy to &ldquo;weight&rdquo; the connections, so I started cataloging <em>how</em> students were interacting: if they cited lines directly from the story, the line was weighted as a 2; if they were strongly referring to the story only through paraphrase, it got a 1.5; no citation whatsoever got a 1. This would then make it easier for me to see how often students were doing something as basic as directly citing the story under discussion in their posts.</p>
<p>It would be cool—I&rsquo;m not sure at all if there is a way to do this from within Gephi—if one could time lapse this whole thing so one could watch the connections get drawn over the course of the semester. One can—and I did—keep track of which connections got made each week (that&rsquo;s as simple as adding another column in the .csv): I had originally wanted to see if I could track the size of my own node over time: my plan was to be a really frequent participant in the first few weeks of the semester. It&rsquo;s easy to show in the graph how those first few weeks of the semester saw me responding to every single student post. I had hoped that my node would become slightly smaller and smaller as the semester went on. By and large, that was true.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that I will continue to fiddle around with all over this the next time I teach this course (which will be in the Spring here after the start of the new year). What kinds of things will I see popping up when I do all this a second time? Will I see a similarity in terms of popularity of texts over the semester? Will I see that similar phenomenon where we have a somewhat small(ish) group of students who are really &ldquo;talkative&rdquo; as we usually do in our f2f classrooms (while the larger group is slightly more reserved)? I have no clue—I&rsquo;m curious to see. (I spent a little bit of time, not much, dabbling with tools/libraries in Python that would do something similar—I know there is <a href="https://igraph.org/python/">iGraph</a> and there no doubt have to be others that I don&rsquo;t even know about. Another slightly more &ldquo;technical&rdquo; rather than philosophical question would be whether or not I would want to figure out a way to automate all of this rather than coding it by hand, so to speak. I know that spaCy has some really powerful tools that one could use to do this: create a custom NER [Named Entity Recognition] with the names of the texts, students, etc., write a script to have the computer find which students are looking at which stories, and then to have it draw the network graph. It would also be somewhat simple enough to think of a way to script the whole process that would also allow you to set some criterion for the whole &ldquo;weighting&rdquo; of the edges, too, though that would need to be a little bit more sophisticated.)</p>
<p>More to come, as always &hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_3/figure_1_stoker_word_cloud.png" alt="Fig. 1: Word Cloud for Bram Stoker&amp;rsquo;s Dracula"></p>
<p>This past July I got an opportunity to do a NEH Summer Seminar over at the University of Iowa (&quot;<a href="https://religion-secularism-novel.sites.uiowa.edu/">Religion, Secularism, and the Novel</a>&quot;), where the group read a number of canonical novels (<em>Crusoe</em>, <em>Silas Marner</em>, <em>Dracula</em>, <em>On the Road</em>, and <em>Home</em>). I enjoyed the seminar and loved all the so-called traditional humanities stuff: deep discussion, attentiveness to rhetoric and form, and all the other things that we literary scholars do so well. I did also fidget around with some of the newer DH methods (at the time it was really just basic computational stuff: counting tokens, plotting frequency dispersions, making silly little Word Clouds, etc.) on those very same texts we were looking at (excluding Robinson&rsquo;s <em>Home</em>).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.nltk.org/book_1ed/ch01.html">&ldquo;lexical dispersion plot&rdquo;</a> for the word &ldquo;time&rdquo; in Stoker&rsquo;s <em>Dracula</em>:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_3/figure_2_time_in_stoker.png" alt="Time"></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a dispersion plot for some of the major characters in <em>Dracula</em>:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_3/figure_3_character_dispersion_plots.png" alt="Character Dispersion Plots"></p>
<p>Here are some common nouns in <em>Dracula</em>:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_3/figure_4_common_word_counts.png" alt="Common Nouns"></p>
<p>Another Dispersion Plot</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really find anything too profound—although it did for some reason surprise me just slightly that a word like &ldquo;time&rdquo; occurred as frequently as it did in <em>Dracula</em> (simple counts found it 373 times [full exploratory notebook for this is available <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/nehsummerseminar2019playground/blob/master/nehexploratorynotebook.ipynb">here</a>—the dispersion plots too at this moment in time aren&rsquo;t actually plotting in Jupyter Notebooks {the <a href="https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/397">issue</a>, it seems, is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54264548/nltk-lexical-dispersion-plot-does-not-show-on-google-colab">known</a> as of 24 December 2019}]).</p>
<p>I also spent a little bit of time messing around with <a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a>—tinkering around with the &ldquo;Part of Speech&rdquo; (POS) tagger and other things on the four texts. Here are some counts of different parts of speech in the four novels:</p>

<p>Dean, in <em>On the Road</em>, always trying to live in the eternal now, makes total sense the verb &ldquo;to be&rdquo; would show up all around him.</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_3/figure_6_kerouac_gender.png" alt="Dean Verbs"></p>
<p>The code to generate the above figure is available <a href="https://gist.github.com/kspicer80/f78d0cfccc43a9e07b05efca6b652b96">here</a>)</p>
<p>One of the day&rsquo;s questions about <em>On the Road</em> at the NEH Seminar had to do with what exactly it is like to read a book like <em>On the Road</em> after the #MeToo movement. Some quick counting of the verbs used to describe Marylou, for instance, comes up as follows:</p>

I am just beginning to dip my toes into water that others are already expert swimmers in—and have been for many many years. </p>
<p>I am not sure either if the kinds of things these digital or computational tools can do will be all they helpful to me in the long run.  The literature is rife with the central question that no doubt is preeminent for most scholars in the humanities, especially those of us who cut our teeth on &ldquo;close reading.&rdquo;  At the same time, learning about some of these new tools would seem to be fine give my recent (as of around July or August of last year) turn to a much more Deleuzian—rather than Derridean—philosophical posture and style of thinking.  Why not use these tools to proliferate new and bizarre ways of thinking about what it is humanities scholars do?  Why not take Nabokov&rsquo;s <em>Lolita</em> and feed it through a bunch of algorithms designed for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">sentiment analysis</a>? (Actually, I&rsquo;m in the process of doing just that and it strikes me that Nabokov&rsquo;s novel would seem to be one of those that should be a nice testing ground for all kinds of work in DH [and it could be already for all I know; as I say, I&rsquo;m just barely getting a sense for what&rsquo;s been done in the field so far, it&rsquo;s all totally brand new to me).  Even from the very first line of that novel Nabokov is playing with the very stuff of language—carving up into phonemes the name of the eponymous love interest of Humbert Humbert.  I also noticed, just flipping through my copy recently, of what a morass <em>Lolita</em> could be for someone first training their (or their algorithm&rsquo;s sights on it):  the constant switch from English to French, the never-ending insertions of French phrases and names and dialogue, and—just staying within the language of English:   Nabokov&rsquo;s constant attention to and awareness of the phonetic stuff of language, e.g. take this from Part One:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; I kept repeating this automatic stuff and holding her under its special spell (spell because of the garbling), and all the while I was mortally afraid that some act of God might interrupt me, might remove the golden load in the sensation of which all my being seemed concentrated, and this anxiety forced me to work, for the first minute or so, more hastily than was consensual with deliberately modulated enjoyment.  <em>The stars that sparkled, and the cars that parkled, and the bars, and the barmen were presently taken over by her &hellip;</em> (<em>The Annotated Lolita</em>, ed. Alfred Appel, Jr. [New York:  McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1970], p. 61)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We all know what a distinguished polymath Nabokov was—and I wonder what DH methods of textual analysis and text mining such a text would be amenable to &hellip; As I say, I&rsquo;ll get a cleaned-up version of the text ready and give it a go.  (I should also probably give a shout out to David H— whose essay on Humbert&rsquo;s aestheticism had been bouncing around in my head all week while over at Notre Dame; not sure why that was &hellip;)  Why do I always feel this urge to never close a parenthesis like this—or at the very least to keep proliferating it indefinitely &hellip;?)  What would a sentiment analysis algorithm do with all of H.P. Lovecraft&rsquo;s fiction?  Anything useful? (I&rsquo;ll get on this one too and report back &hellip;)  </p>
<p>As I say, it&rsquo;s possible all these new tools are totally unhelpful, although I suspect that&rsquo;s not going to end up being the case.  Just one example to suffice for now.  The South Bend DHRI sent along some reading materials to all the participants ahead of the institute.  One little remark in Dennis Tenen&rsquo;s article in <em>Debates in the Digital Humanities</em>, <a href="http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/60">&ldquo;Blunt Instrumentalism: On Tools and Methods&rdquo;</a> mentions the k-means clustering method in topic modeling as an algorithm that is non-deterministic, which means that it &ldquo;will perform differently each time it is run &hellip;&rdquo;  Last academic year while working on the English Department&rsquo;s Program Review I spent a great of time thinking about what it our faculty mean when they talk about &ldquo;close reading.&rdquo;  I found myself returning again and again to talking about the ontology and philosophy of events, as that word is used (very differently) by Derrida and Deleuze. I found myself again and again running into this paradoxical situation where we describe the coming together of reader, text, and this third thing, the &ldquo;event of reading,&rdquo; which is absolutely singular and never to be repeated; simultaneously, this &ldquo;event of reading&rdquo; must be iterable, to use Derrida&rsquo;s language.  I think this idiom of non-deterministic algorithmic behavior could be helpful in giving me another way to describe what it is that we do when we closely read something.  We do something algorithmic—we do not read arbitrarily, simply following our own whims and caprices—; there is a method to our madness, but it is not a deterministic one.</p>
<p>(Rereading some parts of Rita Felski&rsquo;s <em>The Limits of Critique</em> for the <a href="https://religion-secularism-novel.sites.uiowa.edu/">NEH Summer Seminar</a> I&rsquo;ll be attending here very soon, I came across the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One indispensable link in this chain of mediators is a reader whose response is never entirely predictable or knowable.  It is here that literary studies need to steer clear of a vulgar sociology (where a reader is reduced to the sum of her demographical data) as well as of a one-dimensional theory of language (where a reader is a nodal point through which language or discourse flows). Readers are not autonomous, self-contained, centers of meaning, but they are also not mere flotsam and jetsam tossed on the tides of social or linguistic forces that they are helpless to affect or comprehend. When they encounter texts, they do so in all their commonality and quirkiness; they mediate and in turn are mediated, in both predictable and perplexing ways. (<em>The Limits of Critique</em> [Chicago:  U of Chicago P, 2015], p. 171.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very nicely put—I dig it.)</p>

<p>The whole &ldquo;close vs. distant&rdquo; reading issue is no doubt just about gatekeeping, as Ted Underwood has <a href="http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/95">argued</a>, and is one of those things where my (re)turn to Deleuze is helpful:  a logic of opposition should not be chosen over a language of difference—distant reading is perhaps just simply a different way of reading and not necessarily opposed to reading closely. An unsupervised (or supervised) nondeterministic algorithm is what we do when we humans read closely?  Why not?</p>

<p>So after a week-long <a href="http://dhsouthbend.org/dhri/">research institute</a> put together by some fantastic people at the College of St. Mary&rsquo;s and Notre Dame earlier in the summer, I got my hands dirty with a whole host of tools of the trade within the Digital Humanities.  As one can see from the <a href="http://dhsouthbend.org/dhri/curriculum/">curriculum</a>, the week was rather intense and both I and <a href="https://annaioanes.wordpress.com/">my colleague</a> came back exhausted, to be sure, but also full of all kinds of new knowledge and (best of all) a sense of how much knowledge we still need to try to acquire.</p>
<p>Playing around with <a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a>-displaCy and a sentence from Beverly Cleary&rsquo;s <em>Ramona Forever</em> (image shows a &ldquo;dependency parsing&rdquo; for the novel&rsquo;s first sentence—my youngest child is reading all of these books at the moment):</p>
