  <div class="chapter" n="0">
    <h3>Prologue:</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>
      <font color="teal">The story had held us,</font> round the <font color="maroon">fire,</font> sufficiently breathless, but except the obvious
      remark that it was gruesome, as, on <font color="GreenYellow">Christmas
        Eve</font> in an old house, a strange tale should essentially be, I
      remember no comment uttered till somebody happened to say that it was the
      only case he had met in which such a visitation had fallen on a child. <font color="mistyrose">The case,</font> I may mention, was that of an
      apparition in just such an old house as had gathered us for the occasion—an
      appearance, of a dreadful kind, to a little boy sleeping in the room with
      his mother and waking her up in the terror of it; waking her not to
      dissipate his dread and soothe him to sleep again, but to encounter also,
      herself, before she had succeeded in doing so, the same sight that had <font color="teal">shaken him.</font>
      It was this observation that drew from Douglas—not immediately, but <font color="Olive">later in the
        evening</font>—a reply that had the interesting consequence to which I
      call attention. Someone else told a story not particularly effective, <font color="magenta">which I saw he was not following.</font> This I
      took for a sign that he had himself something to produce and that we should
      only have to wait. We waited in fact till <font color="GreenYellow">two nights
        later</font>; but that before we scattered, he brought out what was in
      his mind.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>
      <font color="paleturquoise">“I quite
        agree—in regard to Griffin’s ghost, or whatever it was—that its
        appearing first to the little boy, at so tender an age, adds a
        particular <font color="teal">touch.</font> But it’s not the
        first occurrence of its charming kind that I know to have involved a
        child. If the child gives the effect another turn of the screw, what do
        you say to <em>two</em> children—?”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup>“We
      say, of course,” somebody exclaimed, <font color="SaddleBrown">“that they give two
        turns! Also that we want to hear about them.”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="4"><sup>¶4</sup>I can see Douglas there <font color="maroon">before the fire,</font> to which he had got up to present his back,
      looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in his pockets. <font color="paleturquoise">“Nobody but me,
        till now, has ever heard. It’s quite too horrible.”</font> This,
      naturally, was declared by several voices to give the thing the utmost
      price, and our friend, with quiet art, prepared his triumph by <font color="magenta">turning his eyes over</font> the rest of us and
      going on: <font color="paleturquoise">“It’s
        beyond everything. Nothing at all that I know <font color="teal">touches</font> it.”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="5"><sup>¶5</sup>
      <font color="BlueViolet">“For sheer terror?”</font>
      I remember asking.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="6"><sup>¶6</sup>He seemed to say it was not so simple as that; to be really at a loss how to
      qualify it. <font color="teal">He passed his hand over his
        eyes,</font> made a little wincing grimace. <font color="paleturquoise">“For
        dreadful—dreadfulness!”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="7"><sup>¶7</sup>
      <font color="SaddleBrown">
        <font color="darkgreen">“Oh, how delicious!”</font>
      </font> cried one
      of the women.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="8"><sup>¶8</sup>He took no notice of her; he <font color="magenta">looked at me,</font>
      but as if, instead of me, <font color="magenta">he saw what he spoke
        of.</font>
      <font color="paleturquoise">“For general uncanny
        ugliness and horror and pain.”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="9"><sup>¶9</sup>
      <font color="BlueViolet">“Well then,”</font> I
      said, <font color="BlueViolet">“just sit right
        down and begin.”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="10"><sup>¶10</sup>
      <font color="maroon">He turned round to the fire,</font> gave a kick to a log,
      watched it an instant. <font color="magenta">Then as he faced us
        again:</font>
      <font color="paleturquoise">
        <font color="lightpink">“I can’t
          begin. I shall have to send to town.”</font>
      </font>
      <font color="sienna">There was a unanimous groan at this,</font> and
      much reproach; after which, in his preoccupied way, he explained. <font color="paleturquoise">
        <font color="whitesmoke">“The story’s written.</font> It’s in a locked
        drawer—it has not been out for <font color="GreenYellow">years</font>. <font color="whitesmoke">I
          could write to my man </font> and enclose the key; he could send down
        the packet as he finds it.”
      </font> It was to me in particular that he
      appeared to propound this—<font color="lightpink">appeared almost to appeal for aid
        not to hesitate.</font>
      <font color="orange">He had broken a thickness of ice, the
        formation of many a <font color="Olive">winter</font>;</font>
      <font color="lightpink">
        <font color="sienna">had had his reasons for a long
          silence.</font>
      </font>
      <font color="lightpink">The others resented postponement,</font> but it was just his
      scruples that charmed me. <font color="whitesmoke">I adjured him to write by the
        first post</font> and to agree with us for an early <font color="sienna">
        <font color="sienna">hearing;</font>
      </font>
      then I asked him if the experience in question had been his own. To this his
      answer was prompt.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="11"><sup>¶11</sup>
      <font color="paleturquoise">“Oh, thank God,
        no!”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="12"><sup>¶12</sup>
      <font color="BlueViolet">“And is the <font color="whitesmoke">record</font> yours? <font color="whitesmoke">You took the
          thing down?”</font>
      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="13"><sup>¶13</sup>
      <font color="paleturquoise">“Nothing but the
        impression. I took that <em>here</em>”</font>—<font color="teal">he tapped his heart.</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="14"><sup>¶14</sup>
      <font color="paleturquoise">“I’ve never lost it.”
      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="15"><sup>¶15</sup>
      <font color="BlueViolet">
        <font color="whitesmoke">“Then
          your manuscript—?”</font>
      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="16"><sup>¶16</sup>
      <font color="paleturquoise">
        <font color="whitesmoke">“Is in
          old, faded ink, and in the most beautiful hand.”</font>
      </font>
      <font color="lightpink">He hung fire again.</font>
      <font color="paleturquoise">“A woman’s. She has been
        dead these <font color="Olive">twenty years.</font>
        <font color="purple">She sent me the pages in question before she
          died.”</font>
      </font> They were all <font color="sienna">listening</font> now, and of course there was somebody to be arch, or at
      any rate to draw the inference. But if he put the inference by without a
      smile it was also without irritation. <font color="paleturquoise">“She was a most charming
        person, but she was ten years older than I. She was my sister’s "governess,”</font> he quietly
      said.<font color="paleturquoise">“She was the most
        agreeable woman I’ve ever known in her position; she would have been
        worthy of any whatever. It was long ago, and this episode was long
        before. I was at Trinity, and I found her at home on my coming down the <font color="GreenYellow">
          <font color="Olive">second summer.</font>
        </font> I was much there that
        <font color="GreenYellow">year</font>—it was a beautiful one; and we had, <font color="Olive">in her
          off-hours</font>, some strolls and talks in the garden—talks in
        which she struck me as awfully clever and nice. Oh yes; don’t grin: I
        liked her extremely and am glad to <font color="GreenYellow">this day</font> to think she
        liked me, too. If she hadn’t she wouldn’t have told me. She had never
        told anyone. It wasn’t simply that she said so, but that I knew she
        hadn’t. I was sure; <font color="magenta">I could see.</font> You’ll
        easily judge why when you <font color="sienna">hear.”</font>
      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="17"><sup>¶17</sup>
      <font color="BlueViolet">“Because the thing had
        been such a scare?”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="18"><sup>¶18</sup>He continued to <font color="magenta">fix me.</font>
      <font color="paleturquoise">“You’ll easily
        judge,”</font>
      <font color="mistyrose">he repeated:</font>
      <font color="paleturquoise">“<em>you</em> will.”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="19"><sup>¶19</sup>
      <font color="magenta">I fixed him,</font> too. <font color="BlueViolet">
        <font color="magenta">“I see.</font>
        She was in love.”
      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="20"><sup>¶20</sup>He laughed for the first time. <font color="paleturquoise">“You <em>are</em> acute. <font color="mistyrose">Yes, she was in love.</font> That is, she had been.
        That came out—she couldn’t tell her story without its coming out. <font color="magenta">I saw it, and she saw I saw it;</font> but
        neither of us spoke of it. <font color="lightpink">I remember the time and
          the place—the corner of the lawn, the shade of the great beeches and
          the long, hot <font color="Olive">summer</font> afternoon.</font> It
        wasn’t a scene for a shudder; <font color="mediumpurple">but
          oh—!”</font>
      </font> He quitted the <font color="maroon">fire</font> and dropped
      back into his chair.</div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="21"><sup>¶21</sup>
      <font color="bisque">
        <font color="BlueViolet">“You’ll
          receive the packet <font color="Olive">Thursday morning</font>?”</font>
      </font> I
      inquired.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="22"><sup>¶22</sup>
      <font color="paleturquoise">
        <font color="lightpink">“Probably
          not till <font color="bisque">the second post.”</font>
        </font>
      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="23"><sup>¶23</sup>
      <font color="BlueViolet">
        <font color="mediumpurple">“Well then; after dinner—”</font>
      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="24"><sup>¶24</sup>
      <font color="paleturquoise">“You’ll all meet me
        here?”</font>
      <font color="magenta">He looked us round again.</font>
      <font color="paleturquoise">“Isn’t anybody going?”
      </font> It was almost the tone of hope.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="25"><sup>¶25</sup>
      <font color="BlueViolet">“Everybody will stay!”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="26"><sup>¶26</sup>
      <font color="SlateBlue">“<em>I</em> will”</font>—and <font color="SlateBlue">“<em>I</em> will!”</font> cried the ladies whose
      departure had been <font color="teal">fixed.</font>
      <font color="magenta">Mrs.
        Griffin, however, expressed the need for a little more
        light.</font>
      <font color="Orange">“Who was it she was in
        love with?”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="27"><sup>¶27</sup>
      <font color="BlueViolet">“The story will
        tell,”</font> I took upon myself to reply.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="28"><sup>¶28</sup>
      <font color="SlateBlue">
        <font color="lightpink">“Oh, I can’t wait for the story!”</font>
      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="29"><sup>¶29</sup>
      <font color="paleturquoise">
        <font color="mistyrose">“The story <em>won’t</em>
          tell,”</font>
      </font> said Douglas;
      <font color="paleturquoise">“not in
        any literal, vulgar way.”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="30"><sup>¶30</sup>
      <font color="Orange">“More’s the pity, then.
        That’s the only way I ever understand.”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="31"><sup>¶31</sup>
      <font color="SaddleBrown">“Won’t <em>you</em> tell, Douglas?”</font> somebody else inquired.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="32"><sup>¶32</sup>He sprang to his feet again. <font color="paleturquoise">
        <font color="lightpink">“Yes—<font color="Olive">tomorrow</font>.</font> Now I must go to bed.
        <font color="Olive">Good night</font>.”
      </font>
      <font color="maroon">
        <font color="teal">And quickly catching up a
          candlestick,</font>
      </font> he left us slightly bewildered. <font color="sienna">From our end of the great <font color="brown">brown</font> hall we heard his step on the stair;</font> whereupon
      Mrs. Griffin spoke. <font color="Orange">
        <font color="mistyrose">“Well, if I don’t know who she was in love with, I
          know who <em>he</em> was.”</font>
      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="33"><sup>¶33</sup>
      <font color="Yellow">“She was <font color="GreenYellow">ten
          years older</font>,”</font> said her husband.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="34"><sup>¶34</sup>
      <font color="Orange">“<em><em>Raison de
            plus</em></em>—at that age! But it’s rather nice, his long
        reticence.”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="35"><sup>¶35</sup>
      <font color="Yellow">“<font color="GreenYellow">Forty
          years</font>!”</font> Griffin put in.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="35"><sup>¶35</sup>
      <font color="Orange">“With this outbreak at
        last.”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="37"><sup>¶37</sup>
      <font color="BlueViolet">“The outbreak,”</font> I
      returned, <font color="BlueViolet">“will make a tremendous
        occasion of <font color="GreenYellow">
          <font color="Olive">Thursday night</font>
        </font>;”</font> and
      everyone so agreed with me that, <font color="magenta">in the light
        of it,</font> we lost all attention for everything else. The last story,
      however incomplete and like the mere opening of a serial, had been told;
      <font color="teal">we handshook</font> and <font color="maroon">“candlestuck,”</font> as somebody said, and went to
      bed. I knew <font color="GreenYellow">the next day</font> that <font color="bisque">a letter
        containing the key had, by the first post, gone off to his London apartments</font>; <font color="lightpink">but in spite of—or
        perhaps just on account of—the eventual diffusion of this knowledge we
        quite let him alone till after dinner, till <font color="Olive">such an hour of the
          evening</font>,</font> in fact, <font color="teal">as might
        best accord with the kind of emotion on which our hopes were
        fixed.</font> Then he became as communicative as we could desire and
      indeed gave us his best reason for being so. We had it from him again <font color="maroon">before the fire in the hall,</font> as we had had our mild
      wonders of the previous night. <font color="lime">It appeared that the
        narrative he had promised to read us really required for a proper
        intelligence a few words of prologue.</font> Let me say here distinctly,
      to have done with it, that this narrative, <font color="whitesmoke">from an exact
        transcript of my own made much later, is what I shall presently
        give.</font> Poor Douglas, before his
      death—when it was in sight—<font color="whitesmoke">committed to me the
        manuscript</font>
      <font color="lightpink">that reached him on <font color="GreenYellow">the third of these
          days</font>
      </font> and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, <font color="lime">he began to read to our hushed little circle
        <font color="GreenYellow">
          <font color="Olive">on the night of the fourth</font>
        </font>.
      </font>
      <font color="mistyrose">The departing ladies who had said they would stay
        didn’t, of course, thank heaven, stay:</font> they departed, in
      consequence of arrangements made, in a rage of curiosity, as they professed,
      produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up. But that
      only made <font color="sienna">his little final auditory</font> more
      compact and select, kept it, <font color="maroon">round the hearth,</font> subject
      to a common thrill.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="38"><sup>¶38</sup>The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the
      tale at a point after it had, in a manner, begun. The fact to be in
      possession of was therefore that his old friend, the youngest of several
      daughters of a poor country parson, had, at the age of twenty, on taking
      service for the first time in the schoolroom, come up to HampshireLondon, in trepidation, to answer in person an advertisement
      that had already placed her in brief correspondence with the advertiser.
      This person proved, on her presenting herself, for judgment, at a house in Harley Street, that impressed her as vast and imposing—this prospective
      patron proved a gentleman, a bachelor in the prime of life, such a figure as
      had never risen, save in a dream <font color="lime">or an old
        novel,</font> before a fluttered, anxious girl out of a Hampshire vicarage. One could easily fix his type; it never, happily,
      dies out. He was handsome and bold and pleasant, off-hand and gay and kind.
      He struck her, inevitably, as gallant and splendid, but what took her most
      of all and gave her the courage she afterward showed was that he put the
      whole thing to her as a kind of favor, an obligation he should gratefully
      incur. She conceived him as rich, but as fearfully extravagant—saw him all
      in a glow of high fashion, of good looks, of expensive habits, of charming
      ways with women. He had for his own town residence a big house filled with
      the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase; but it was to his
      country home, an old family place in Essex, that he wished her immediately to proceed. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="39"><sup>¶39</sup>He had been left, by the death of their parents in India, guardian to a small nephew and a small niece, children of a
      younger, a military brother, whom he had lost <font color="GreenYellow">two years before</font>.
      These children were, by the strangest of chances for a man in his position—a
      lone man without the right sort of experience or a grain of patience—<font color="teal">very heavily on his hands.</font> It had all been
      a great worry and, on his own part doubtless, a series of blunders, but he
      immensely pitied the poor chicks and had done all he could; had in
      particular sent them down to his other house, the proper place for them
      being of course the country, and kept them there, from the first, with the
      best people he could find to look after them, parting even with his own
      servants to wait on them and going down himself, whenever he might, <font color="magenta">to see how they were doing.</font> The awkward
      thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own
      affairs took up all his time. He had put them in possession of Bly, which was healthy and secure, and had placed at the head of
      their little establishment—but below stairs only—an excellent woman,
      Mrs. Grose, whom he was sure his
      visitor would like and who had formerly been maid to his mother. She was now
      housekeeper and was also acting for the time as superintendent to the little
      girl, of whom, without children of her own, she was, by good luck, extremely
      fond. There were plenty of people to help, but of course the young lady who
      should go down as governess would be
      in supreme authority. She would also have, in <font color="GreenYellow">holidays</font>, to look
      after the small boy, who had been for a term at school—young as he was to be
      sent, but what else could be done?—and who, as the holidays were about to
      begin, would be back from one day to the other. There had been for the two
      children at first a young lady whom they had had the misfortune to lose. She
      had done for them quite beautifully—she was a most respectable person—till
      her death, the great awkwardness of which had, precisely, left no
      alternative but the school for little Miles. Mrs. Grose, since
      then, in the way of manners and things, had done as she could for Flora; and there were, further, a cook, a
      housemaid, a dairywoman, an old pony, an old groom, and an old gardener, all
      likewise thoroughly respectable. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="40"><sup>¶40</sup>So far had Douglas presented his picture

        Meanwhile, of course, the prospect struck her as slightly grim. She was
        young, untried, nervous: it was a <font color="magenta">vision of
          serious duties and little company, of really great loneliness.</font>
        She hesitated—took a couple of days to consult and consider. But the
        salary offered much exceeded her modest measure, and on a second

  <div class="chapter" n="1">
    <h3>Chapter: 1</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>I remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops, a little
      seesaw of the right throbs and the wrong. After rising, in town, to meet his
      appeal, I had at all events a couple of <font color="GreenYellow">very bad days</font>—found
      myself doubtful again, felt indeed sure I had made a mistake. In this state
      of mind I spent <font color="Olive">the long hours</font> of bumping, swinging coach that
      carried me to the stopping place at which I was to be met by a vehicle from
      the house. This convenience, I was told, had been ordered, and I found, <font color="lightpink">toward the close of the <font color="Olive">June</font>
        <font color="Olive">afternoon</font>, a commodious fly in waiting for me. Driving at
        that hour, on a lovely day, through a country to which the <font color="Olive">summer</font> sweetness
      </font> seemed to offer me a
      friendly welcome, my fortitude mounted afresh and, as we turned into the
      avenue, encountered a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the point to
      which it had sunk. I suppose I had expected, or had dreaded, something so
      melancholy that what greeted me was a good surprise. I remember as a most
      pleasant impression the broad, clear front, its open windows and fresh
      curtains and the pair of maids looking out; I remember the lawn and the
      bright flowers and the crunch of my wheels on the gravel and the clustered
      treetops over which the rooks circled and cawed in the <font color="gold">golden</font> sky. The scene had a greatness that
      made it a different affair from my own scant home, and there immediately
      appeared at the door, with a little girl in her hand, a civil person who
      dropped me as decent a curtsy as if I had been the mistress or a
      distinguished visitor. I had received in Harley Street a narrower notion of the place, and that, as I recalled it,
      made me think the proprietor still more of a gentleman, suggested that what
      I was to enjoy might be something beyond his promise. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>I had no drop again till <font color="Olive">the next day</font>, for I was carried
      triumphantly through <font color="Olive">the following hours</font> by my introduction to
      the younger of my pupils. The little girl who accompanied Mrs. Grose<font color="magenta">appeared to me on the spot a creature so charming
        as to make it a great fortune to have to do with her. She was the most
        beautiful child I had ever seen,</font> and I afterward wondered that my
      employer had not told me more of her. I slept little that night—I was too
      much excited; and this astonished me, too, I recollect, remained with me,
      adding to my sense of the liberality with which I was treated. The large,
      impressive room, one of the best in the house, the great state bed, <font color="teal">as I almost felt it,</font> the full, figured
      draperies, the long glasses in which, for the first time, <font color="magenta">I could see myself from head to foot,</font> all
      struck me—like the extraordinary charm of my small charge—as so many things
      thrown in. It was thrown in as well, from the first moment, that I should
      get on with Mrs. Grose in a relation
      over which, on my way, in the coach, I fear I had rather brooded. The only
      thing indeed that in this early outlook might have made me shrink again was
      the clear circumstance <font color="magenta">of her being so glad to
        see me. I perceived within <font color="Olive">half an hour</font> that she was so
        glad—stout, simple, plain, clean, wholesome woman—as to be positively on
        her guard against showing it too much. I wondered even then a little why
        she should wish not to show it, and that, with reflection, with
        suspicion, might of course have made me uneasy.</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup> But it was a comfort that there could be no uneasiness in a connection with
      anything so beatific as <font color="magenta">the radiant image of my
        little girl, the vision of whose angelic beauty</font> had probably more
      than anything else to do with the restlessness that, before morning, made me
      several times rise and wander about my room to take in the whole picture and
      prospect; <font color="magenta">to watch, from my open window, the faint <font color="Olive">summer</font> dawn, to look at such portions of the
        rest of the house as I could catch,</font> and <font color="sienna">to
        listen, while, in the fading dusk, the first birds began to twitter, for
        the possible recurrence of a sound or two, less natural and not without,
        but within, that I had fancied I heard.</font>
      <font color="sienna">There had been a moment when I believed I recognized, faint
        and far, the cry of a child; </font> there had been another when I found
      myself just consciously starting as at the passage, before my door, of a
      light footstep. <font color="magenta">But these fancies were not marked enough
        not to be thrown off, and it is only in the light, or the gloom, I
        should rather say, of other and subsequent matters that they now come
        back to me. </font>
      <font color="magenta">To watch,</font> teach, “form” little Flora would too evidently be the making of a
      happy and useful life. It had been agreed between us downstairs that after
      this first occasion I should have her as a matter of course at
      <font color="Olive">night</font>, her small white bed
      being already arranged, to that end, in my room. What I had undertaken was
      the whole care of her, and she had remained, just this last time, with
      Mrs. Grose only as an effect of our
      consideration for my inevitable strangeness and her natural timidity. In
      spite of this timidity—which the child herself, in the oddest way in the
      world, had been perfectly frank and brave about, allowing it, without a sign
      of uncomfortable consciousness, with the deep, sweet serenity indeed of one
      of Raphael’s holy infants, to be discussed, to be imputed to her, and to
      determine us—I feel quite sure she would presently like me. It was part of
      what I already liked Mrs. Grose herself
      for, the pleasure I could see her feel in my admiration and wonder as I sat
      at supper with four tall candles and with my pupil, in a high chair and a
      bib, brightly facing me, between them, over bread and milk. There were
      naturally things that in Flora’s presence
      could pass between us only as prodigious and gratified looks, obscure and
      roundabout allusions.

      with a plate in her hand, <font color="magenta">beaming</font> at our companion,

    <div class="paragraph" n="9"><sup>¶9</sup>
      <font color="magenta">I can still see Mrs.
        Grose’s broad face</font> as she took this in. <font color="Periwinkle">“In Harley Street?”</font>

        under care of the guard, and is to be met by the same carriage.” </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="14"><sup>¶14</sup>I forthwith expressed that the proper as well as the pleasant and friendly
      thing would be therefore that on the arrival of the public conveyance I
      should be in waiting for him with his little sister; an idea in which
      Mrs. Grose concurred so heartily that I somehow
      took her manner as a kind of comforting pledge—never falsified, thank
      heaven!—that we should on every question be quite at one. Oh, she was glad I
      was there! </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="15"><sup>¶15</sup>What I felt <font color="GreenYellow">the next day</font> was, I suppose, nothing that could be
      fairly called a reaction from the cheer of my arrival; it was probably at
      the most only a slight oppression produced by a fuller measure of the scale,
      as I walked round them, <font color="magenta">gazed up at them</font>,
      took them in, of my new circumstances. They had, as it were, an extent and
      mass for which I had not been prepared and in the presence of which I found
      myself, freshly, a little scared as well as a little proud. <font color="lightpink">Lessons, in this agitation, certainly suffered some delay;</font> I
      reflected that my first duty was, by the gentlest arts I could contrive, to
      win the child into the sense of knowing me. I spent the day with her
      out-of-doors; I arranged with her, to her great satisfaction, that it should
      be she, she only, who might show me the place. She showed it step by step
      and room by room and secret by secret, with droll, delightful, childish talk
      about it and with the result, in <font color="Olive">half an hour</font>, of our becoming
      immense friends. Young as she was, I was struck, throughout our little tour,
      with her confidence and courage with the way, in empty chambers and dull
      corridors, on crooked staircases that made me pause and even on the summit
      of an old machicolated square tower that made me dizzy, her
      <font color="Olive">morning</font> music, her disposition to tell me so many more
      things than she asked, rang out and led me on. I have not seen Bly since <font color="GreenYellow">the day</font> I left it, <font color="magenta">and I daresay that to my older and more informed
        eyes </font> it would now appear sufficiently contracted. But as my
      little conductress, with her hair of <font color="gold">gold</font> and
      her frock of <font color="azure">blue</font>, danced before me round
      corners and pattered down passages, <font color="lime">I had
        the view of a castle of romance inhabited by a rosy sprite, such a place
        as would somehow, for diversion of the young idea, take all color out of
        storybooks and fairytales. Wasn’t it just a storybook over which I had
        fallen adoze and a dream? </font> No; it was a big, ugly, antique, but
      convenient house, embodying a few features of a building still older,
      half-replaced and half-utilized, in which I had the fancy of our being
      almost as lost as a handful of passengers in a great drifting ship. Well, I
      was, strangely, at the helm!

  <div class="chapter" n="2">
    <h3>Chapter: 2</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>This came home to me when, <font color="GreenYellow">two days later</font>, I drove over with
      Flora to meet, as Mrs. Grose said, the little gentleman; and all
      the more for an incident that, presenting itself <font color="GreenYellow">
        <font color="Olive">the second
          evening</font>
      </font>, had deeply disconcerted me. <font color="GreenYellow">The first
        day</font> had been, on the whole, as I have expressed, reassuring; but
      I was to see it wind up in keen apprehension. <font color="bisque">The
        postbag, that <font color="Olive">evening</font>—it came late—contained a letter for
        me, which, however, in the hand of my employer, I found to be composed
        but of a few words enclosing another, addressed to himself, with a seal
        still unbroken. </font>
      <font color="blueviolet">“This, I recognize, is from the headmaster, and the headmaster’s
        an awful bore. Read him, please; deal with him; but mind you don’t
        report. Not a word. I’m off!” </font> I broke the seal with a great effort—so great a one that I was a long
      time coming to it; took the unopened missive at last up to my room and only
      attacked it just before going to bed. I had better have let it wait till
      <font color="Olive">morning</font>, for it gave me <font color="Olive">a second sleepless
        night</font>. With no counsel to take, <font color="GreenYellow">the next day</font>, I was
      full of distress; and it finally got so the better of me that <font color="lime">I determined to open myself at least to

      some coherence and with the mere aid of her presence to my own mind, I went
      on: <font color="Indigo">“That he’s an
        injury to the others.”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="12"><sup>¶12</sup>At this, with one of the quick turns of simple folk, she suddenly <font color="maroon">flamed up</font>. <font color="Periwinkle">“Master Miles! <em>him</em> an injury?” </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="13"><sup>¶13</sup>There was such a flood of good faith in it that, though I had not yet seen
      the child, my very fears made me jump to the absurdity of the idea. I found
      myself, to meet my friend the better, offering it, on the spot,
      sarcastically. <font color="Indigo">“To his
        poor little innocent mates!”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="14"><sup>¶14</sup>
      <font color="Periwinkle">“It’s too

    <div class="paragraph" n="15"><sup>¶15</sup>

      <font color="magenta">I felt forthwith a new impatience to see him;</font> it was
      the beginning of a curiosity that, <font color="Olive">for all the next hours</font>, was
      to deepen almost to pain. Mrs. Grose was
      aware, I could judge, of what she had produced in me, and she followed it up
      with assurance.

    <div class="paragraph" n="17"><sup>¶17</sup>
      <font color="Periwinkle">“You might as well
        believe it of the little lady. Bless her,” </font> she added the next

    <div class="paragraph" n="18"><sup>¶18</sup>I turned and <font color="magenta">saw that Flora, whom, <font color="Olive">ten minutes before</font>, I had
        established in the schoolroom with a sheet of white paper, a pencil, and a copy of nice “round O’s,” now
        presented herself to view at the open door. </font> She expressed in her
      little way an extraordinary detachment from disagreeable duties, looking to
      me, however, with a great childish light that seemed to offer it as a mere
      result of the affection she had conceived for my person, which had rendered
      necessary that she should follow me. I needed nothing more than this to feel
      the full force of Mrs. Grose’s
      comparison, and, <font color="teal">catching my pupil in my arms,
        covered her with kisses in which there was a sob of atonement. </font>

      my colleague, especially as, <font color="Olive">toward evening</font>, I began to fancy
      she rather sought to avoid me. I overtook her, I remember, on the staircase;
      we went down together, and at the bottom I detained her, holding her there with a hand on her arm.<font color="Indigo">“I take what you said
        to me <font color="Olive">at noon</font> as a declaration that <em>you’ve</em> never known him to be bad.” </font> She threw back
      her head; she had clearly, by this time, and very honestly, adopted an
      attitude. <font color="Periwinkle">“Oh, never
        known him—I don’t pretend <em>that!</em>” </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="20"><sup>¶20</sup>I was upset again. <font color="Indigo">“Then

    <div class="paragraph" n="25"><sup>¶25</sup>Then, keeping pace with her answer, <font color="Indigo">“So do I!” </font> I eagerly brought out. </div>

        took the children altogether for the interval. But our young lady never

    <h3>Chapter: 3</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>Her thus turning her back on me was fortunately not, for my just
      preoccupations, a snub that could check the growth of our mutual esteem. We
      met, after I had brought home little Miles,
      more intimately than ever on the ground of my stupefaction, my general
      emotion: so monstrous was I then ready to pronounce it that such a child as
      had now been revealed to me should be under an interdict. I was a little
      late on the scene, and I felt, <font color="magenta">as he stood
        wistfully looking out for me before the door of the inn at which the
        coach had put him down, that I had seen him, on the instant, without and
        within, in the great glow of freshness, the same positive fragrance of
        purity, in which I had, from the first moment, seen his little sister.
      </font> He was incredibly beautiful, and Mrs.
      Grose had put her finger on it: everything but a sort of
      passion of tenderness for him was swept away by his presence. <font color="teal">What I then and there took him to my heart for
      </font> was something divine that I have never found to the same degree in
      any child—his indescribable little air of knowing nothing in the world but
      love. It would have been impossible to carry a bad name with a greater
      sweetness of innocence, and by the time I had got back to Bly with him I remained merely bewildered—so far, that is, as I was
      not outraged—by the sense of the <font color="bisque">horrible letter locked
        up in my room, in a drawer. </font> As soon as I could compass a private

      indignant.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="14"><sup>¶14</sup>This, at all events, was for the time: a time so full that, as I recall the
      way it went, it reminds me of all the art I now need to make it a little
      distinct. What I look back at with amazement is the situation I accepted. I
      had undertaken, with my companion, to see it out, and I was under a charm,
      apparently, that could smooth away the extent and the far and difficult
      connections of such an effort. I was lifted aloft ona great wave of
      infatuation and pity. I found it simple, in my ignorance, my confusion, and
      perhaps my conceit, to assume that I could deal with a boy whose education
      for the world was all on the point of beginning. I am unable even to
      remember at <font color="Olive">this day</font> what proposal I framed for the end of his
      holidays and the resumption of his studies. Lessons with me, indeed, that
      charming <font color="GreenYellow">summer</font>, we all had a theory that he was
      to have; but I now feel that, <font color="Olive">for weeks</font>, the lessons must have
      been rather my own. I learned something—at first, certainly—that hadn ot
      been one of the teachings of my small, smothered life; learned tobe amused,
      and even amusing, and not to think for the morrow. It was the first time, in
      a manner, that I had known space and air and freedom, all the music of
      summer and all the mystery of nature. And then there was consideration—and
      consideration was sweet. Oh, it was a trap—not designed, but deep—to my
      imagination, to my delicacy, perhaps to my vanity; to whatever, in me, was
      most excitable. The best way to picture it all is to say that I was off my
      guard. They gave me so little trouble—they were of a gentleness so
      extraordinary. <font color="teal">I used to speculate—but even this
        with a dim disconnectedness—as to how the rough future (for all futures
        are rough!) would handle them and might bruise them. </font> They had the
      bloom of health and happiness; and yet, as if I had been in charge of a pair
      of little grandees, of princes of the blood, for whom everything, to be
      right, would have to be enclosed and protected, the only form that, in my
      fancy, the after years could take for them was that of a romantic, a really
      royal extension of the garden and the park. It may be, of course, above all,
      that what suddenly broke into this gives the previous time a charm of
      stillness—that hush in which something gathers or crouches. The change was
      actually like the spring of a beast. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="15"><sup>¶15</sup>In the <font color="Olive">first weeks</font> the days were long; they often, at their
      finest,gave me what I used to call my own hour, the hour when, for my
      pupils, teatime and bedtime having come and gone, I had, before my final
      retirement, a small interval alone. Much as I liked my companions,
      <font color="Olive">this hour</font> was the thing in <font color="Olive">the day</font> I liked
      most; and I liked it best of all when, as the light faded—or rather, I
      should say, the day lingered and the last calls of the last birds sounded,
      in a flushed sky, from the old trees—I could take a turn into the grounds
      and enjoy, almost with a sense of property that amused and flattered me, the
      beauty and dignity of the place. It was a pleasure at these moments to feel
      myself tranquil and justified; doubtless, perhaps, also to reflect that by
      my discretion, my quiet good sense and general high propriety, I was giving
      pleasure—if he ever thought of it!—to the person to whose pressure I had
      responded. What I was doing was what he had earnestly hoped and directly
      asked of me, and that I <em>could</em>, after all, do it
      proved even a greater joy than I had expected. I daresay I fancied myself,
      in short, a remarkable young woman and took comfort in the faith that this
      would more publicly appear. Well, I needed to be remarkable to offer a front
      to the remarkable things that presently gave their first sign.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="16"><sup>¶16</sup>It was plump, <font color="Olive">one afternoon</font>, in the middle of my very hour: the
      children were tucked away, and I had come out for my stroll. One of the
      thoughts that, as I don’t in the least shrink now from noting, used to be
      with me in these wanderings <font color="lime">was that it
        would be as charming as a charming story suddenly to meet someone.
        Someone would appear there at the turn of a path and would stand before
        me and smile and approve. </font> I didn’t ask more than that—I only
      asked that he should <em>know;</em> and the only way to
      be sure he knew would be to see it, and the kind light of it, in his
      handsome face. That was exactly present to me—by which I mean the face
      was—when, on the first of these occasions, at the end of a long <font color="GreenYellow">June</font> day, I stopped short on emerging from one of the
      plantations and coming into view of the house. What arrested me on the
      spot—<font color="magenta">and with a shock much greater than any
        vision had allowed for</font>—was the sense that <font color="magenta">my imagination had, in a flash, turned real.
      </font> He did stand there!—but high up, beyond the lawn and at the very top
      of the tower to which, on that <font color="Olive">first morning</font>, little Flora had conducted me. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="17"><sup>¶17</sup>This tower was one of a pair—square, incongruous, crenelated structures—that
      were distinguished, for some reason, though I could see little difference,
      as the new and the old. They flanked opposite ends of the house and were
      probably architectural absurdities, redeemed in a measure indeed by not
      being wholly disengaged nor of a height too pretentious, dating, in their
      gingerbread antiquity, <font color="lime">from a romantic
        revival that was already a respectable past. </font> I admired them, had
      fancies about them, for we could all profit in a degree, especially when
      they loomed through the dusk, by the grandeur of their actual battlements;
      yet it was not at such an elevation that the figure I had so often invoked
      seemed most in place. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="18"><sup>¶18</sup>It produced in me, this figure, in the clear twilight, I remember, two
      distinct gasps of emotion, which were, sharply, the shock of my first and
      that of my second surprise. My second was a violent perception of the
      mistake of my first: the man who met my eyes was not the person I had
      precipitately supposed. <font color="magenta">There came to me thus a
        bewilderment of vision of which, <font color="GreenYellow">after these years</font>, there
        is no living view that I can hope to give. </font> An unknown man in a
      lonely place is a permitted object of fear to a young woman privately bred;
      and the figure that faced me was—<font color="Olive">a few more seconds</font> assured
      me—as little anyone else I knew as it was the image that had been in my
      mind. I had not seen it in Harley Street—I had not seen it anywhere. The place, moreover, in the
      strangest way in the world, had, on the instant, and by the very fact of its
      appearance, become a solitude. To me at least, making my statement here with
      a deliberation with which I have never made it, the whole feeling of the
      moment returns. It was as if, while I took in—what I did take in—all the
      rest of the scene had been stricken with death. <font color="sienna">I
        can hear again, as I write, the intense hush in which the sounds of
        <font color="Olive">evening</font> dropped. The rooks stopped cawing in the <font color="gold">golden</font> sky, and <font color="Olive">the friendly
          hour</font> lost, for the minute, all its voice.
      </font> But there
      was no other change in nature, unless indeed it were a change that I saw
      with a stranger sharpness. The <font color="gold">gold</font> was still
      in the sky, the clearness in the air, and the man who looked at me over the
      battlements was <font color="magenta">as definite as a picture in a
        frame. </font> That’s how I thought, with extraordinary quickness, of
      each person that he might have been and that he was not. We were confronted
      across our distance quite long enough for me to ask myself with intensity
      who then he was and to feel, as an effect of my inability to say, a wonder
      that in a few instants more became intense.</div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="19"><sup>¶19</sup>The great question, or one of these, is, afterward, I know, with regard to
      certain matters, the question of how long they have lasted. Well, this
      matter of mine, think what you will of it, <font color="teal">lasted while I caught at a dozen possibilities,</font> none of which
      made a difference for the better, that I could see, in there having been in
      the house—and for how long, above all?—a person of whom I was in ignorance.
      It lasted while I just bridled a little with the sense that my office
      demanded that there should be no such ignorance and no such person. It
      lasted while this visitant, at all events—and there was <font color="teal">a touch of the strange freedom, </font> as I
      remember, in the sign of familiarity of his wearing no hat—<font color="magenta">
        <font color="teal">seemed to fix
          me,</font>
      </font> from his position, with just the question, just the
      scrutiny through the fading light, that his own presence provoked. <font color="sienna">
        <font color="sienna">
          <font color="magenta">We were too far apart to call to each
            other, but there was a moment at which, at shorter range, some
            challenge between us, breaking the hush, would have been the
            right result of our straight mutual stare.</font>
        </font>
      </font> He
      was in one of the angles, the one away from the house, very erect, as it
      struck me, and with both hands on the ledge. <font color="magenta">So I
        saw him as I see the letters I form on this page;</font> then, exactly,
      <font color="Olive">after a minute</font>, as if to add to the spectacle, he slowly
      changed his place—passed, <font color="magenta">looking at me hard all
        the while, </font> to the opposite corner of the platform. Yes, I had the
      sharpest sense that during this transit <font color="magenta">he never
        took his eyes from me, and I can see at this moment <font color="teal">the way his hand, as he went, passed from one
          of the crenelations to the next. </font>
      </font> He stopped at the other corner, but less long, and even as he turned
      away still markedly <font color="magenta">fixed me.</font> He turned
      away; that was all I knew.

    <h3>Chapter: 4</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>It was not that I didn’t wait, on this occasion, for more, for I was rooted
      as deeply as I was shaken. Was there a “secret” at Bly— <font color="lime">Ann Radcliffe<em>The Mystery of Udolpho</em> a mystery of Udolpho or Charlotte Bronte <em>Jane Eyre</em> an insane, an unmentionable relative kept in unsuspected
        confinement? </font> I can’t say how long I turned it over, or how long, in a confusion of
      curiosity and dread, I remained where I had had my collision; I only recall
      that when I re-entered the house darkness had quite closed in. Agitation, in
      the interval, certainly had held me and driven me, for I must, in circling
      about the place, have walked three miles; but I was to be, later on, so much
      more overwhelmed that this mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human
      chill. The most singular part of it, in fact—singular as the rest had
      been—was the part I became, in the hall, aware of in meeting Mrs. Grose. <font color="magenta">This
        picture comes back to me </font> in the general train—the impression, as
      I received it on my return, of the wide white
      panelled space, bright in the lamplight and with its portraits and <font color="red">red</font> carpet, and of the good surprised look of my
      friend, which immediately told me she had missed me. It came to me
      straightway, <font color="teal">under her contact,</font> that, with
      plain heartiness, mere relieved anxiety at my appearance, she knew nothing
      whatever that could bear upon the incident I had there ready for her. <font color="magenta">I had not suspected in advance that <font color="teal">her comfortable face would pull me up, </font>
      </font> and I somehow measured the importance of what I had seen by my thus
      finding myself <font color="lightpink">hesitate to mention it</font>. Scarce
      anything in the whole history seems to me so odd as this fact that my real
      beginning of fear was one, as I may say, with the instinct of sparing my
      companion. On the spot, accordingly, in the pleasant hall <font color="magenta">and with her eyes on me, </font> I, for a reason
      that I couldn’t then have phrased, achieved an inward resolution—offered a
      vague pretext for my lateness and, with the plea of the beauty of the night
      and of the heavy dew and wet feet, went as soon as possible to my room. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>Here it was another affair; here, <font color="GreenYellow">for many days after</font>, it was a
      queer affair enough. There were hours, from day to day—or at least there
      were moments, snatched even from clear duties—when I had to shut myself up
      to think. It was not so much yet that I was more nervous than I could bear
      to be as that I was remarkably afraid of becoming so; for the truth I had
      now to turn over was, simply and clearly, the truth that I could arrive at
      no account whatever of the visitor with whom I had been so inexplicably and
      yet, as it seemed to me, so intimately concerned. It took little time to see
      that I could sound without forms of inquiry and without exciting remark any
      domestic complications. The shock I had suffered must have sharpened all my
      senses; I felt sure, <font color="GreenYellow">at the end of three days</font> and as the result
      of mere closer attention, that I had not been practiced upon by the servants
      nor made the object of any “game.” Of whatever it was that I knew, nothing
      was known around me. There was but one sane inference: someone had taken a
      liberty rather gross. That was what, repeatedly, I dipped into my room and
      locked the door to say to myself. We had been, collectively, subject to an
      intrusion; some unscrupulous traveler, curious in old houses, had made his
      way in unobserved, enjoyed the prospect from the best point of view, and
      then stolen out as he came. <font color="magenta">If he had given me
        such a bold hard stare, that was but a part of his indiscretion. The
        good thing, after all, was that we should surely see no more of him.
      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup> This was not so good a thing, I admit, as not to leave me to judge that
      what, essentially, made nothing else much signify was simply my charming
      work. My charming work was just my life with Miles and Flora, and
      through nothing could I so like it as through feeling that I could throw
      myself into it in trouble. The attraction of my small charges was a constant
      joy, leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my original fears, the
      distaste I had begun by entertaining for the probable gray prose of my
      office. There was to be no gray prose, it appeared, and no long grind; so
      how could work not be charming that presented itself as <font color="GreenYellow">daily</font>
      beauty? It was all the <font color="lime">romance of the
        nursery and the poetry of the schoolroom. </font> I don’t mean by this,
      of course, that we studied only fiction and verse; I mean I can express no
      otherwise the sort of interest my companions inspired. How can I describe
      that except by saying that instead of growing used to them—and it’s a marvel
      for a governess: I call the
      sisterhood to witness!—I made constant fresh discoveries. There was one
      direction, assuredly, in which these discoveries stopped: deep obscurity
      continued to cover the region of the boy’s conduct at school. It had been
      promptly given me, I have noted, to face that mystery without a pang.
      Perhaps even it would be nearer the truth to say that—without a word—he
      himself had cleared it up. He had made the whole charge absurd. My
      conclusion bloomed there with the real <font color="darkmagenta">rose</font>
      flush of his innocence: he was only too fine and fair for the little horrid,
      unclean school-world, and he had paid a price for it. I reflected acutely
      that the sense of such differences, such superiorities of quality, always,
      on the part of the majority—which could include even stupid, sordid
      headmasters—turn infallibly to the vindictive. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="4"><sup>¶4</sup>Both the children had a gentleness (it was their only fault, and it never
      made Miles a muff) that kept them—how shall
      I express it?—almost impersonal and certainly quite unpunishable. They were
      like the cherubs of the anecdote, who had—morally, at any rate—nothing to
      whack! I remember feeling with Miles in
      especial as if he had had, as it were, no history. We expect of a small
      child a scant one, but there was in this beautiful little boy something
      extraordinarily sensitive, yet extraordinarily happy, that, more than in any
      creature of his age I have seen, struck me as beginning anew <font color="GreenYellow">each
        day</font>. He had never <font color="Olive">for a second</font> suffered. I took this
      as a direct disproof of his having really been chastised. If he had been
      wicked he would have <font color="mistyrose"> “caught” it, and I should have
        caught it by the rebound</font>—I should have found the trace. I found
      nothing at all, and he was therefore an angel. He never spoke of his school,
      never mentioned a comrade or a master; and I, for my part, was quite too
      much disgusted to allude to them. Of course I was under the spell, and the
      wonderful part is that, even at the time, I perfectly knew I was. But I gave
      myself up to it; it was an antidote to any pain, and I had more pains than
      one. <font color="bisque">I was in receipt in <font color="GreenYellow">these days</font> of
        disturbing letters from home, </font> where things were not going well.
      But with my children, what things in the world mattered? That was the
      question I used to put to my scrappy retirements. I was dazzled by their
      loveliness. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="5"><sup>¶5</sup>There was <font color="GreenYellow">a Sunday</font>—to get on—when it rained with such force and
      for so many hours that there could be no procession to church; in
      consequence of which, as <font color="GreenYellow">the day</font> declined, I had arranged with
      Mrs. Grose that, should <font color="Olive">the
        evening</font> show improvement, we would attend together the late
      service. The rain happily stopped, and I prepared for our walk, which,
      through the park and by the good road to the village, would be a matter of
      <font color="Olive">twenty minutes</font>. Coming downstairs to meet my colleague in
      the hall, I remembered a pair of gloves that had required three stitches and
      that had received them—with a publicity perhaps not edifying—while I sat
      with the children at their tea, served on <font color="GreenYellow">Sundays</font>, by
      exception, in that cold, clean temple of mahogany and brass, the “grown-up”
      dining room. The gloves had been dropped there, and I turned in to recover
      them. <font color="GreenYellow">The day</font> was gray enough, but <font color="Olive">the afternoon</font>
      light still lingered, and it enabled me, on crossing the threshold, not only
      to recognize, on a chair near the wide window, then closed, the articles I
      wanted, <font color="magenta">but to become aware of a person on the
        other side of the window and looking straight in. </font>
      <font color="magenta">One step into the room had sufficed; my vision
        was instantaneous; it was all there. </font>
      <font color="magenta">The person looking straight in was the person who had
        already appeared to me. He appeared thus again with I won’t say greater
        distinctness, for that was impossible, but with a nearness that
        represented a forward stride in our intercourse and made me, as I met
        him, catch my breath and turn cold. </font>
      <font color="magenta">He was the same—he was the same, and seen, this
        time, as he had been seen before, from the waist up, the window, though
        the dining room was on the ground floor, not going down to the terrace
        on which he stood. </font>
      <font color="magenta">His face was close to the glass, yet the effect
        of this better view was, strangely, only to show me how intense the
        former had been. He remained but <font color="Olive">a few seconds</font>—long enough
        to convince me he also saw and recognized; but it was as if I had been
        looking at him for <font color="GreenYellow">years</font> and had known him always. </font>
      Something, however, happened this time that had not happened before; <font color="magenta">his stare into my face, through the glass and
        across the room, was as deep and hard as then, but it quitted me for a
        moment during which I could still watch it, see it fix successively
        several other things. </font> On the spot there came to me the added
      shock of a certitude that it was not for me he had come there. He had come
      for someone else.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="6"><sup>¶6</sup>The <font color="magenta">flash</font> of this knowledge—for it was knowledge in
      the midst of dread—produced in me the most extraordinary effect, started as
      I stood there, a sudden vibration of duty and courage. I say courage because
      I was beyond all doubt already far gone. I bounded straight out of the door
      again, reached that of the house, got, in an instant, upon the drive, and,
      passing along the terrace as fast as I could rush, turned a corner and came
      full in sight. But it was in sight of nothing now—my visitor had vanished. I
      stopped, I almost dropped, with the real relief of this; but I took in the
      whole scene—I gave him time to reappear. I call it <font color="Olive">time</font>, but
      how long was it? I can’t speak to the purpose <font color="GreenYellow">today</font> of the
      duration of these things. That kind of measure must have left me: they
      couldn’t have lasted as they actually appeared to me to last. The terrace
      and the whole place, the lawn and the garden beyond it, all I could see of
      the park, were empty with a great emptiness. There were shrubberies and big
      trees, but I remember the clear assurance I felt that none of them concealed
      him. He was there or was not there: not there if I didn’t see him. I got
      hold of this; then, instinctively, instead of returning as I had come, went
      to the window. It was confusedly present to me that I ought to place myself
      where he had stood. I did so; <font color="magenta">I applied my face
        to the pane and looked, as he had looked,</font> into the room. As if, at
      this moment, to show me exactly what his range had been, Mrs. Grose, as I had done for himself just
      before, came in from the hall. <font color="magenta">With this I had
        the full image</font> of a <font color="mistyrose">repetition of what had
        already occurred. </font>
      <font color="magenta">She saw me as I had seen my own visitant;</font>
      she pulled up short as I had done; I gave her something of the shock that I
      had received. She turned white, and this made
      me ask myself if I had blanched as much. <font color="magenta">She
        stared,</font> in short, and retreated on just <em>my
      </em> lines, and I knew she had then passed out and come round to me and
      that I should presently meet her. I remained where I was, and while I waited
      I thought of more things than one. But there’s only one I take space to
      mention. I wondered why <em>she</em> should be scared.

    <h3>Chapter: 6</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>It took of course more than that particular passage to place us together in
      presence of what we had now to live with as we could—my dreadful liability
      to impressions of the order so vividly exemplified, and my companion’s
      knowledge, henceforth—a knowledge half consternation and half compassion—of
      that liability. There had been, <font color="Olive">this evening</font>, after the
      revelation left me, for <font color="Olive">an hour</font>, so prostrate—there had been,
      for either of us, no attendance on any service but a little service of tears
      and vows, of prayers and promises, a climax to the series of mutual
      challenges and pledges that had straightway ensued on our retreating
      together to the schoolroom and shutting ourselves up there to have
      everything out. The result of our having everything out was simply to reduce
      our situation to the last rigor of its elements. <font color="magenta">She herself had seen nothing, not the shadow of a shadow, and nobody in
        the house but the governess was
        in the governess’s plight; </font>
      yet she accepted without directly impugning my sanity the truth as I gave it
      to her, and ended by showing me, on this ground, an awestricken tenderness,
      an expression of the sense of my more than questionable privilege, of which
      the very breath has remained with me as that of the sweetest of human
      charities. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>What was settled between us, accordingly, that night, was that we thought we
      might bear things together; and I was not even sure that, in spite of her
      exemption, it was she who had the best of the burden. I knew <font color="Olive">at this
        hour</font>, I think, as well as I knew later, what I was capable of
      meeting to shelter my pupils; but it took me some time to be wholly sure of
      what my honest ally was prepared for to keep terms with so compromising a
      contract. I was queer company enough—quite as queer as the company I
      received; but as I trace over what we went through <font color="magenta">I see </font> how much common ground we must have
      found in the one idea that, by good fortune, <em>could
      </em> steady us. It was the idea, the second movement, that led me
      straight out, as I may say, of the inner chamber of my dread. I could take
      the air in the court, at least, and there Mrs.
      Grose could join me. Perfectly can I recall now the
      particular way strength came to me before we separated for the night. <font color="magenta">We had gone over and over every feature of what I

      That he might was an awful conception, and yet, somehow, I could keep it at
      bay; which, moreover, as we lingered there, was what I succeeded in
      practically proving. <font color="magenta">I had an absolute certainty
        that I should see again what I had already seen, </font> but something
      within me said that by offering myself bravely as the sole subject of such

      as an expiatory victim and guard the tranquility of my companions. The
      children, in especial, I should thus fence about and absolutely save. I

      follow them; yet how often and how passionately, <font color="GreenYellow">for a week</font>, we
      came back together to the subject! Much as we had discussed it that
      <font color="GreenYellow">
        <font color="Olive">Sunday night</font>
      </font>, I was, in the immediate
      <font color="Olive">later hours</font> in especial—for it may be imagined whether I
      slept—still haunted with the shadow of something she had not told me. <font color="antiquewhite">I myself had kept back nothing, but there was a
        word Mrs. Grose had kept back.
      </font> I was sure, moreover, <font color="Olive">by morning</font>, that this was not from
      a failure of frankness, but because on every side there were fears. It seems
      to me indeed, in retrospect, that by the time the morrow’s sun was high I
      had restlessly <font color="lime">read into the fact before us
        almost all the meaning they were to receive from subsequent and
        morecruel occurrences. </font> What they gave me above all was just the
      sinister figure of the living man—the dead one would keep awhile!—and of
      <font color="GreenYellow">the months</font> he had continuously passed at Bly, which, added up, made a formidable stretch. The limit of this
      evil time had arrived only when, on the dawn of a <font color="GreenYellow">winter’s</font>
      <font color="Olive">morning</font>, Peter Quint was
      found, by a laborer going to early work, stone dead on the road from the
      village: a catastrophe explained—superficially at least—by a visible wound
      to his head; such a wound as might have been produced—and as, on the final
      evidence, <em>had </em> been—by a fatal slip, in the dark
      and after leaving the public house, on the steepish icy slope, a wrong path
      altogether, at the bottom of which he lay. The icy slope, the turn mistaken
      at night and in liquor, accounted for much—practically, in the end and after
      the inquest and boundless chatter, for everything; but there had been
      matters in his life—strange passages and perils, secret disorders, vices
      more than suspected—that would have accounted for a good deal more.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="40"><sup>¶40</sup>I scarce know how to put my story into words that shall be a credible picture
      of my state of mind; but I was in <font color="Olive">these days</font> literally able to
      find a joy in the extraordinary flight of heroism the occasion demanded of
      me. <font color="magenta">I now saw that I had been asked for a
        service admirable and difficult; and there would be a greatness in
        letting it be seen</font>—oh, in the right quarter!—that I could succeed
      where many another girl might have failed. It was an immense help to me—I
      confess I rather applaud myself as I look back!—<font color="magenta">that I saw my service so strongly and so simply. </font> I was there to
      protect and defend the little creatures in the world the most bereaved and
      the most lovable, the appeal of whose helplessness had suddenly become only
      too explicit, a deep, constant ache of one’s own committed heart. We were
      cut off, really, together; we were united in our danger. They had nothing
      but me, and I—well, I had <em> them</em>. It was in short
      a magnificent chance. This chance presented itself to me in an image richly
      material. I was a screen—I was to stand before them. <font color="magenta">
        <font color="magenta">The more I saw, the
          less they would.</font>
      </font>
      <font color="magenta">I began to watch them in a stifled suspense, a
        disguised excitement that might well, had it continued too long, have
        turned to something like madness. </font> What saved me, <font color="magenta">as I now see,</font> was that it turned to
      something else altogether. It didn’t last as suspense—it was superseded by
      horrible proofs. Proofs, I say, yes— <font color="teal">from the
        moment I really took hold.</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="41"><sup>¶41</sup>This moment dated from <font color="Olive">an afternoon hour</font> that I happened to
      spend in the grounds with the younger of my pupils alone. We had left
      Miles indoors, on the <font color="red">red</font> cushion of a deep window seat; <font color="lime">he had wished to finish a book, </font> and I had
      been glad to encourage a purpose so laudable in a young man whose only
      defect was an occasional excess of the restless. His sister, on the
      contrary, had been alert to come out, and I strolled with her <font color="Olive">half an
        hour</font>, seeking the shade, for the sun was still high and the day
      exceptionally warm. I was aware afresh, with her, as we went, of how, like
      her brother, she contrived—it was the charming thing in both children—to let
      me alone without appearing to drop me and to accompany me without appearing
      to surround. They were never importunate and yet never listless. My
      attention to them all really went to seeing them amuse themselves immensely
      without me: this was a spectacle they seemed actively to prepare and that
      engaged me as an active admirer. <font color="salmon">I walked in a
        world of their invention—they had no occasion whatever to draw upon
        mine; so that my time was taken only with being, for them, some
        remarkable person or thing that the game of the moment required and that
        was merely, thanks to my superior, my exalted stamp, a happy and highly
        distinguished sinecure. I forget what I was on the present occasion; I
        only remember that I was something very important and very quiet and
        that Flora was playing very hard. We
        were on the edge of the lake, and, as we had lately begun geography, the
        lake was the Sea of Azof.</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="42"><sup>¶42</sup>Suddenly, in these circumstances, I became aware that, on the other side of
      the Sea of Azof, we had an interested
      spectator. The way this knowledge gathered in me was the strangest thing in
      the world—the strangest, that is, except the very much stranger in which it
      quickly merged itself. I had sat down with a piece of work—for I was
      something or other that could sit—on the old stone bench which overlooked
      the pond; and in this position I began to take in with certitude, and yet
      <font color="magenta">without direct vision</font>, the presence, at a
      distance, of a thin person.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="43"><sup>¶43</sup>The old trees, the thick shrubbery, made a great and pleasant shade, but it
      was all suffused with the brightness of the hot, still hour. There was no
      ambiguity in anything; none whatever, at least, in the conviction I from one
      moment to another found myself forming as to <font color="magenta">what
        I should see straight before me and across the lake as a consequence of
        raising my eyes. </font> They were attached at this juncture to the
      stitching in which I was engaged, and I can feel once more the spasm of my
      effort not to move them till I should so have steadied myself as to be able
      to make up my mind what to do. There was an alien object in view—a figure
      whose right of presence I instantly, passionately questioned. I recollect
      counting over perfectly the possibilities, reminding myself that nothing was
      more natural, for instance, then the appearance of one of the men about the
      place, or even of a messenger, a postman, or a tradesman’s boy, from the
      village. That reminder had as little effect on my practical certitude as I
      was conscious—still even without looking—of its having upon the character
      and attitude of our visitor. Nothing was more natural than that these things
      should be the other things that they absolutely were not. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="44"><sup>¶44</sup>Of the positive identity of the apparition I would assure myself as soon as
      the small clock of my courage should have ticked out the right second;
      meanwhile, with an effort that was already sharp enough, <font color="magenta">I transferred my eyes straight to little Flora,</font> who, at the moment, was about
      ten yards away. My heart had stood still for an instant with the wonder and
      terror of the question <font color="magenta">whether she too would
        see;</font> and I held my breath <font color="sienna">while I waited
        for what a cry from her, what some sudden innocent sign either of
        interest or of alarm, would tell me. </font> I waited, but nothing came;
      then, in the first place—and there is something more dire in this, I feel,
      than in anything I have to relate—I was determined by a sense that,
      <font color="Olive">within a minute</font>, <font color="sienna">all sounds from
        her had previously dropped;</font> and, <font color="Olive">in the second</font>, by
      the circumstance that, also <font color="Olive">within the minute</font>, she had, in her
      play, turned her back to the water.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="45"><sup>¶45</sup>This was her attitude <font color="magenta">when I at last looked at
        her—looked with the confirmed conviction that we were still, together,
        under direct personal notice. </font> She had picked up a small flat
      piece of wood, which happened to have in it a little hole that had evidently
      suggested to her the idea of sticking in another fragment that might figure
      as a mast and make the thing a boat. This second morsel, <font color="magenta">as I watched her,</font> she was very markedly and
      intently attempting to tighten in its place. </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="46"><sup>¶46</sup>My apprehension of what she was doing sustained me so that <font color="Olive">after some
        seconds</font> I felt I was ready for more. <font color="magenta">Then I again shifted my eyes—I faced what I had to face.</font>

    <h3>Chapter: 8</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>What I had said to Mrs. Grose was true
      enough: there were in the matter I had put before her depths and
      possibilities that I lacked resolution to sound; so that when we met once
      more in the wonder of it we were of a common mind about the duty of
      resistance to extravagant fancies. We were to keep our heads if we should
      keep nothing else—difficult indeed as that might be in the face of what, in
      our prodigious experience, was least to be questioned. <font color="Olive">Late that
        night</font>, while the house slept, we had another talk in my room,
      <font color="magenta">when she went all the way with me as to its
        being beyond doubt that I had seen exactly what I had seen. </font>
      <font color="teal">To hold her perfectly in the pinch of
        that,</font> I found I had only to ask her how, if I had “made it up,” I
      came to be able to give, of each of the persons appearing to me, a picture
      disclosing, to the last detail, their special marks—a portrait on the
      exhibition of which she had instantly recognized and named them. She wished
      of course—small blame to her!—to sink the whole subject; and I was quick to
      assure her that my own interest in it had now violently taken the form of a
      search for the way to escape from it. <font color="mistyrose">I encountered
        her on the ground of a probability that with recurrence—for recurrence
        we took for granted</font>—I should get used to my danger, distinctly
      professing that my personal exposure had suddenly become the least of my
      discomforts. It was my new suspicion that was intolerable; and yet even to
      this complication <font color="Olive">the later hours of the day</font> had brought a
      little ease.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>On leaving her, after my first outbreak, I had of course returned to my
      pupils, associating the right remedy for my dismay with that sense of their
      charm which I had already found to be a thing I could positively cultivate
      and which had never failed me yet. I had simply, in other words, plunged
      afresh into Flora’s special society and
      there become aware—it was almost a luxury!— <font color="teal">that
        she could put her little conscious hand straight upon the spot that
        ached. </font>
      <font color="magenta">She had looked at me in sweet speculation and
        then had accused me to my face of having “cried.” </font> I had supposed
      I had brushed away the ugly signs: but I could literally—for the time, at
      all events—rejoice, under this fathomless charity, that they had not
      entirely disappeared. <font color="magenta">To gaze into the depths of
        <font color="azure">blue</font> of the child’s eyes
      </font> and
      pronounce their loveliness a trick of premature cunning was to be guilty of
      a cynicism in preference to which I naturally preferred to abjure my
      judgment and, so far as might be, my agitation. I couldn’t abjure for merely
      wanting to, but I could repeat to Mrs.
      Grose—as I did there, over and over, in the small
      <font color="Olive">hours</font>—that with their voices in the air, their pressure on
      one’s heart, and their fragrant faces against one’s cheek, everything fell
      to the ground but their incapacity and their beauty. It was a pity that,
      somehow, to settle this once for all, I had equally to re-enumerate the
      signs of subtlety that, in the afternoon, by the lake had made a miracle of
      my show of self-possession. It was a pity to be obliged to reinvestigate the
      certitude of the moment itself and repeat how it had come to me as a
      revelation that the inconceivable communion I then surprised was a matter,
      for either party, of habit. It was a pity that I should have had to quaver
      out again the reasons for my not having, in my delusion, so much as
      questioned that the little girl <font color="magenta">saw our visitant
        even as I actually saw Mrs. Grose
        herself, and that she wanted, by just so much as she did thus see, to
        make me suppose she didn’t, and at the same time, without showing
        anything, arrive at a guess as to whether I myself did! </font> It was a
      pity that I needed once more to describe the portentous little activity by
      which she sought to divert my attention—the perceptible increase of
      movement, the greater intensity of play, the singing, the gabbling of
      nonsense, and the invitation to romp.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup> Yet if I had not indulged, to prove there was nothing in it, in this review,
      I should have missed the two or three dim elements of comfort that still
      remained to me. I should not for instance have been able to asseverate to my
      friend that I was certain—which was so much to the good—that <em>I</em> at least had not betrayed myself. I should not
      have been prompted, by stress of need, by desperation of mind—I scarce know
      what to call it—to invoke such further aid to intelligence as might spring
      from <font color="teal">pushing my colleague fairly to the wall. </font>
      <font color="teal">She had told me, bit by bit, under pressure, a
        great deal;</font> but a small shifty spot on the wrong side of it all
      still sometimes brushed my brow like the wing of a bat; and I remember how
      on this occasion—for the sleeping house and the concentration alike of our
      danger and our watch seemed to help—I felt the importance of giving the last
      jerk to the curtain. <font color="Indigo">“I
        don’t believe anything so horrible,” </font> I recollect saying; <font color="Indigo">“no, let us put it
        definitely, my dear, that I don’t. But if I did, you know, there’s a
        thing I should require now, just without sparing you the least bit
        more—oh, not a scrap, come!—to get out of you. What was it you had in
        mind when, in our distress, before Miles came back, <font color="bisque">over the letter from
          his school, </font> you said, under my insistence, that you didn’t
        pretend for him that he had not literally <em>ever
        </em> been ‘bad’? He has <em>not</em> literally
        ‘ever,’ in <font color="GreenYellow">these weeks</font> that I myself have lived with him
        and <font color="magenta">so closely watched him;</font> he has been
        an imperturbable little prodigy of delightful, lovable goodness.
        Therefore you might perfectly have made the claim for him if you had
        not, as it happened, <font color="magenta">seen an exception to
          take. </font> What was your exception, and to what passage in <font color="magenta">
          <font color="magenta">your personal
            observation of him did you refer?”</font>
        </font>
      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="4"><sup>¶4</sup>It was a dreadfully austere inquiry, but levity was not our note, and, at any
      rate, before the gray dawn admonished us to separate I had got my answer.
      What my friend had had in mind proved to be immensely to the purpose. It was
      neither more nor less than the circumstance that for a period of
      <font color="GreenYellow">several months</font>Quint and the boy had been perpetually
      together. It was in fact the very appropriate truth that she had ventured to
      criticize the propriety, to hint at the incongruity, of so close an
      alliance, and even to go so far on the subject as a frank overture to
      Miss Jessel. Miss Jessel had, with a most strange manner,
      requested her to mind her business, and the good woman had, on this,
      directly approached little Miles. What she
      had said to him, <font color="teal">since I pressed, </font> was
      that <font color="magenta"><em>she</em></font> liked to see young gentlemen not forget their station.

      still impress upon me. <font color="Periwinkle">“I was sure, at any rate,” </font> she added, <font color="Periwinkle">“that he didn’t. But he denied certain

        didn’t forbid him.” </font>

      <font color="Indigo">“There are directions

      returned to her first example—the one to which she had just previously

      <font color="Indigo">“Oh, yes!”</font>
      <font color="sienna">And we exchanged there, in the stillness, a sound

        man—” </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="29"><sup>¶29</sup>
      <font color="Periwinkle">“Miss Flora was with the woman. It suited them

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="30"><sup>¶30</sup>It suited me, too, I felt, only too well; by which I mean that it suited
      exactly the particularly deadly view I was in the very act of forbidding
      myself to entertain. But I so far succeeded in checking the expression of
      this view that I will throw, just here, no further light on it than may be
      offered by the mention of my final observation to Mrs. Grose. <font color="Indigo">“His having lied and been impudent are, I confess,
        less engaging specimens than I had hoped to have from you of the

    <div class="paragraph" n="31"><sup>¶31</sup>It made me blush, <font color="GreenYellow">the next minute</font>, <font color="magenta">to

    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>
      <font color="mistyrose">I waited and waited,</font> and <font color="GreenYellow">the days</font>,
      as they elapsed, took something from my consternation. A very few of them,
      in fact, passing, <font color="magenta">in constant sight of my
        pupils,</font> without a fresh incident, sufficed to give to grievous
      fancies and even to odious memories a kind of brush of the sponge. I have
      spoken of the surrender to their extraordinary childish grace as a thing I
      could actively cultivate, and it may be imagined if I neglected now to
      address myself to this source for whatever it would yield. Stranger than I
      can express, certainly, was the effort to struggle against my new lights; it
      would doubtless have been, however, a greater tension still had it not been
      so frequently successful. I used to wonder how my little charges could help
      guessing that I thought strange things about them; and the circumstances
      that these things only made them more interesting was not by itself a direct
      aid to keeping them in the dark. <font color="magenta">I trembled
        lest they should see that they <em>were </em> so
        immensely more interesting. </font> Putting things at the worst, at all
      events, as in meditation I so often did, any clouding of their innocence
      could only be—blameless and foredoomed as they were—a reason the more for
      taking risks. There were moments when, by an irresistible impulse, <font color="teal">I found myself catching them up and pressing them
        to my heart. </font> As soon as I had done so I used to say to myself:
      <font color="Indigo">“What will they
        think of that? Doesn’t it betray too much?” </font> It would have been
      easy to get into a sad, wild tangle about how much I might betray; but the
      real account, I feel, of the hours of peace that I could still enjoy was
      that the immediate charm of my companions was a beguilement still effective
      even under the shadow of the possibility that it was studied. For if it
      occurred to me that I might occasionally excite suspicion by the little
      outbreaks of my sharper passion for them, <font color="magenta">so too
        I remember wondering if I mightn’t see a queerness in the traceable
        increase of their own demonstrations. </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>They were at this period extravagantly and preternaturally fond of me; which,
      after all, I could reflect, was no more than a graceful response in children
      perpetually bowed over and hugged. The homage of which they were so lavish
      succeeded, in truth, for my nerves, quite as well as if I never appeared to
      myself, as I may say, <font color="teal">literally to catch them at
        a purpose in it. </font> They had never, I think, wanted to do so many
      things for their poor protectress; I mean—though they got their lessons
      better and better, which was naturally what would please her most—in the way
      of diverting, entertaining, surprising her; reading her passages, telling
      her stories, acting her charades, pouncing out at her, in disguises, as
      animals and historical characters, and above all astonishing her by the
      “pieces” they had secretly got by heart and could interminably recite. I
      should never get to the bottom—were I to let myself go even now—of the
      prodigious private commentary, all under still more private correction, with
      which, in <font color="GreenYellow">these days</font>, I overscored <font color="Olive">their full
        hours</font>. <font color="magenta">
        <font color="magenta">They had shown me</font>
      </font> from the first a facility for
      everything, a general faculty which, taking a fresh start, achieved
      remarkable flights. They got their little tasks as if they loved them, and
      indulged, from the mere exuberance of the gift, in the most unimposed little
      miracles of memory. They not only popped out at me as tigers and as Romans,
      but as Shakespeareans, astronomers, and navigators. This was so singularly
      the case that it had presumably much to do with the fact as to which, at
      <font color="GreenYellow">the present day</font>, I am at a loss for a different
      explanation: I allude to my unnatural composure on the subject of another
      school for Miles. What I remember is that I
      was content not, for the time, to open the question, and that contentment
      must have sprung from the sense of his perpetually striking show of
      cleverness. He was too clever for a bad governess, for a parson’s daughter, to spoil; and the strangest if
      not the brightest thread in the pensive embroidery I just spoke of was the
      impression I might have got, if I had dared to work it out, that hew asunder
      some influence operating in his small intellectual life as a tremendous
      incitement.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup>If it was easy to reflect, however, that such a boy could postpone school, it
      was at least as marked that for such a boy to have been “kicked out” by a
      schoolmaster was a mystification without end. Let me add that in their
      company now—and I was careful almost never to be out of it—<font color="Peru">I could follow no scent very far.</font> We lived
      in a cloud of music and love and success and private theatricals. The
      musical sense in each of the children was of the quickest, <font color="mistyrose">but the elder in especial had a marvelous knack of
        catching and repeating. </font> The schoolroom piano broke into all
      gruesome fancies; and when that failed there were confabulations in corners,
      with a sequel of one of them going out in the highest spirits in order to
      “come in” as something new. I had had brothers myself, and it was no
      revelation to me that little girls could be slavish idolaters of little
      boys. What surpassed everything was that there was a little boy in the world
      who could have for the inferior age, sex, and intelligence so fine a
      consideration. They were extraordinarily at one, and to say that they never
      either quarreled or complained is to make the note of praise coarse for
      their quality of sweetness. Sometimes, indeed, when I dropped into
      coarseness, I perhaps came across traces of little understandings between
      them by which one of them should keep me occupied while the other slipped
      away. There is a <em>naïf </em> side, I suppose, in all
      diplomacy; but if my pupils practiced upon me, it was surely with the
      minimum of grossness. It was all in the other quarter that, after a lull,
      the grossness broke out.</div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="4"><sup>¶4</sup>
      <font color="lightpink">I find that I really hang back; but I must take my
        plunge.</font> In going on with the record of what was hideous at
      Bly, I not only challenge the most liberal faith—for which I little
      care; but—and this is another matter—I renew what I myself suffered, I again
      push my way through it to the end. There came suddenly <font color="Olive">an hour</font>
      after which, as I look back, the affair seems to me to have been all pure
      suffering; but I have at least reached the heart of it, and the straightest
      road out is doubtless to advance. One <font color="Olive">evening</font>—with nothing to
      lead up or to prepare it—<font color="teal">I felt the cold touch
        of the impression that had breathed on me </font> the night of my arrival
      and which, much lighter then, as I have mentioned, I should probably have
      made little of in memory had my subsequent sojourn been less agitated. <font color="lime">I had not gone to bed; I sat reading by a
        couple of candles. There was a roomful of old books at Bly—<font color="GreenYellow">last-century
          fiction</font>, some of it, which, to the extent of a distinctly
        deprecated renown, but never to so much as that of a stray specimen, had
        reached the sequestered home and appealed to the unavowed curiosity of
        my youth. I remember that the book I had in my hand </font> was Fielding’s<em>Amelia</em> ; also that I was wholly awake. I recall further both a general
      conviction that it was horribly late <font color="magenta">and a
        particular objection to looking at my watch. </font> I figure, finally,
      that the white curtain draping, in the fashion
      of <font color="GreenYellow">those days</font>, the head of Flora’s little bed, shrouded, as I had assured myself long
      before, the perfection of childish rest. I recollect in short that, though I
      was deeply interested in my author, I found myself, at the turn of a page
      and with his spell all scattered, <font color="magenta">looking straight up from
        him and hard at the door of my room. </font> There was a moment during
      which I listened, reminded of the faint sense I had had, the first night, of
      there being something undefinably astir in the house, and noted the soft
      breath of the open casement just move the half-drawn blind. Then, with all
      the marks of a deliberation that must have seemed magnificent had there been
      anyone to admire it, <font color="lime">I laid down my
        book,</font> rose to my feet, and, taking a candle, went straight out of
      the room and, from the passage, on which my light made little impression,
      noiselessly closed and locked the door.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="5"><sup>¶5</sup>I can say now neither what determined nor what guided me, but I went straight
      along the lobby, holding my candle high, <font color="magenta">till I
        came within sight of the tall window that presided over the great turn
        of the staircase. </font> At this point I precipitately found myself
      aware of three things. They were practically simultaneous, yet they had
      flashes of succession. My candle, under a bold flourish, went out, and I
      perceived, by the uncovered window, that the yielding dusk of <font color="Olive">earliest
        morning</font> rendered it unnecessary. Without it, the next instant,
      <font color="magenta">I saw that there was someone on the stair.
      </font> I speak of sequences, but I required <font color="Olive">no lapse of seconds</font>
      to stiffen myself for a third encounter with Quint. The apparition had reached the landing halfway up and
      was therefore on the spot nearest the window, <font color="magenta">where at sight of me, it stopped short and fixed me exactly as it had
        fixed me from the tower and from the garden. </font>
      <font color="mistyrose">:He knew me as well as I knew him;</font> and so, in
      the cold, faint twilight, with a glimmer in the high glass and another on
      the polish of the oak stair below, we faced each other in our common
      intensity. He was absolutely, on this occasion, a living, detestable,
      dangerous presence. But that was not the wonder of wonders; I reserve this
      distinction for quite another circumstance: the circumstance that dread had
      unmistakably quitted me and that there was nothing in me there that didn’t
      meet and measure him.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="6"><sup>¶6</sup>I had plenty of anguish after that extraordinary moment, but I had, thank
      God, no terror. And he knew I had not—I found myself at the end of an
      instant magnificently aware of this. I felt, in a fierce rigor of
      confidence, that if I stood my ground a minute I should cease—for the time,
      at least—to have him to reckon with; and during <font color="Olive">the minute</font>,
      accordingly, the thing was as human and hideous as a real interview: hideous
      just because it <em>was</em> human, as human as to have
      met alone, in <font color="Olive">the small hours</font>, in a sleeping house, some enemy,
      some adventurer, some criminal. <font color="sienna">
        <font color="magenta">It was the dead silence of our long
          gaze</font>
      </font> at such close quarters that gave the whole horror, huge
      as it was, its only note of the unnatural. If I had met a murderer in such a
      place and at <font color="Olive">such an hour</font>, we still at least would have spoken.
      Something would have passed,in life, between us; if nothing had passed, one
      of us would have moved.</div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="7"><sup>¶7</sup>The moment was so prolonged that it would have taken but little more to make
      me doubt if even <em>I</em> were in life. I can’t express
      what followed it save by saying that <font color="sienna">the silence
        itself</font>—which was indeed in a manner an attestation of my
      strength—became the element into which <font color="magenta">I saw
        the figure disappear; </font> in which <font color="magenta">:I
        definitely saw it turn as I might have seen the low wretch to which it
        had once belonged turn on receipt of anorder, and pass, with my eyes on
        the villainous back that no hunch could have more disfigured, straight
        down the staircase and into the darkness in which the next bend was
        lost.</font>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="chapter" n="10">
    <h3>Chapter: 10</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>I remained awhile at the top of the stair, but with the effect presently of
      understanding that when my visitor had gone, he had gone: then I returned to
      my room. <font color="magenta">The foremost thing I saw there by the
        light of the candle I had left burning was that Flora’s little bed was empty; </font> and on this I
      caught my breath with all the terror that, <font color="Olive">five minutes before</font>,
      I had been able to resist. I dashed at the place in which I had left her
      lying and over which (for the small silk counterpane and the sheets were
      disarranged) the white curtains had been
      deceivingly pulled forward; then my step, to my unutterable relief, <font color="sienna">produced an answering sound:</font>
      <font color="magenta">I perceived an agitation of the window
        blind,</font> and the child, ducking down, emerged rosily from the other
      side of it. She stood there in so much of her candor and so little of her
      nightgown, with her <font color="pink">pink</font> bare feet and the <font color="gold">golden</font> glow of her curls. <font color="magenta">She looked intensely grave,</font> and I had never
      had such a sense of losing an advantage acquired (the thrill of which had
      just been so prodigious) as on my consciousness that she addressed me with a
      reproach. <font color="Indigo">“You naughty:
        where <em>have </em> you been?” </font> —instead of
      challenging her own irregularity I found myself arraigned and explaining.
      She herself explained, for that matter, with the loveliest, eagerest
      simplicity. She had known suddenly, as she lay there, that I was out of the
      room, <font color="magenta">and had jumped up to see what had become of
        me. </font> I had dropped, with the joy of her reappearance, back into my
      chair—feeling then, and then only, a little faint; <font color="teal">and she had pattered straight over to me, thrown herself upon my knee,
        given herself to be held with the flame of the candle full in the
        wonderful little face that was still flushed with sleep. </font>
      <font color="magenta">I remember closing my eyes an instant,
        yieldingly, consciously, as before the excess of something beautiful
        that shone out of the <font color="azure">blue</font> of her own. </font>
      <font color="Indigo">
        <font color="magenta">“You were looking for me out of the
          window?”</font>
      </font> I said. <font color="Indigo">“You
        thought I might be walking in the grounds?” </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>
      <font color="Green">“Well, you know, I thought
        someone was”</font>—she never blanched as she smiled out that at me.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup>
      <font color="magenta">Oh, how I looked at her now!</font>
      <font color="Indigo">“And did you see
        anyone?”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="4"><sup>¶4</sup>
      <font color="Green">“Ah, <em>no!</em>” </font> she returned, almost with the full privilege of
      childish inconsequence, resentfully, though with a long sweetness in her
      little drawl of the negative.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="5"><sup>¶5</sup>At that moment, in the state of my nerves, I absolutely believed she lied;
      <font color="magenta">and if I once more closed my eyes it was
        before the dazzle of the three or four possible ways in which I might
        take this up. </font> One of these, for a moment, tempted me with such
      singular intensity that, to withstand it, <font color="teal">I must
        have gripped my little girl with a spasm that, wonderfully, she
        submitted to without a cry or a sign of fright. </font> Why not break out
      at her on the spot and have it all over?—give it to her straight in her
      lovely little <font color="magenta">lighted</font> face? <font color="Indigo">
        <font color="magenta">“You see, you see,</font> you <em>know</em> that you do and that you already quite
        suspect I believe it; therefore, why not frankly confess it to me, so
        that we may at least live with it together and learn perhaps, in the
        strangeness of our fate, where we are and what it means?”
      </font> This
      solicitation dropped, alas, as it came: if I could immediately have
      succumbed to it I might have spared myself—<font color="magenta">well, you’ll see what.</font> Instead of succumbing I sprang again to my
      feet, <font color="magenta">looked at her bed,</font> and took a
      helpless middle way.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="6"><sup>¶6</sup>

    <div class="paragraph" n="8"><sup>¶8</sup>

    <div class="paragraph" n="9"><sup>¶9</sup>She absolutely declined to be puzzled; she <font color="magenta">turned
        her eyes </font> to the <font color="maroon">flame of the candle</font> as if
      the question were as irrelevant, or at any rate as impersonal, as Mrs.
      Marcet or nine-times-nine. <font color="Green">“Oh, but you know,” </font> she quite adequately answered, <font color="Green">“that you might come back,
        you dear, and that you <em>have!</em>” </font> And
      after a little, when she had got into bed, I had, for a long time,<font color="teal">by almost sitting on her to hold her hand, </font>
      to prove that I recognized the pertinence of my return.</div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="10"><sup>¶10</sup>You may imagine the general complexion, from that moment, of <font color="GreenYellow">my
        nights</font>. I <font color="mistyrose">repeatedly </font> sat up till I
      didn’t know when; I selected moments when my roommate unmistakably slept,
      and, stealing out, took noiseless turns in the passage and even pushed as
      far as to where I had last met Quint.</div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="11"><sup>¶11</sup>But I never met him there again; and I may as well say at once that I on no
      other occasion <font color="magenta">saw him in the house.</font> I just
      missed, on the staircase, on the other hand, a different adventure. <font color="magenta">Looking down it from the top I once recognized the
        presence of a woman seated on one of the lower steps with her back
        presented to me, her body half-bowed and her head, in an attitude of
        woe, in her hands. </font> I had been there but an instant, however, <font color="magenta">when she vanished without looking round at me. </font>
      <font color="magenta">I knew, nonetheless, exactly what dreadful face
        she had to show;</font> and I wondered whether, if instead of being above
      I had been below, I should have had, for going up, the same nerve I had
      lately shown Quint. Well, there
      continued to be plenty of chance for nerve. On the eleventh night after my
      latest encounter with that gentleman—they were all numbered now—I had an
      alarm that perilously skirted it and that indeed, from the particular
      quality of its unexpectedness, proved quite my sharpest shock. It was
      precisely the first night during this series that, weary with watching, I
      had felt that I might again without laxity lay myself down at <font color="Olive">my old
        hour</font>. I slept immediately and, as I afterward knew, till about
      one o’clock; but when I woke it was to sit straight up, as completely roused
      <font color="teal">as if a hand had shook me.</font>
      <font color="maroon">I had left a light burning, but it was now out, and I felt
        an instant certainty that Flora had
        extinguished it. </font> This brought me to my feet and straight, in the
      darkness, to her bed, which I found she had left. <font color="magenta">A glance at the window enlightened me further, and the striking of a
        match completed the picture. </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="12"><sup>¶12</sup>The child had again got up— <font color="maroon">this time blowing out the taper, </font>
      <font color="magenta">and had again, for some purpose of observation or
        response, squeezed in behind the blind and was peering out into the
        night. </font>
      <font color="magenta">That she now saw—as she had not, I had satisfied
        myself, the previous time—was proved to me by the fact that she was
        disturbed neither by my reillumination nor by the haste I made to get
        into slippers and into a wrap. </font> Hidden, protected, absorbed, she
      evidently rested on the sill—the casement opened forward—and gave herself
      up. There was a great still moon to help her, and this fact had counted in
      my quick decision. <font color="magenta">She was face to face with the
        apparition we had met at the lake, and could now communicate with it as
        she had not then been able to do. </font> What I, on my side, had to care
      for was, without disturbing her, to reach, from the corridor, some other
      window in the same quarter. <font color="sienna">I got to the door
        without her hearing me; </font> I got out of it, closed it, and listened,
      from the other side, for some sound from her. While I stood in the passage
      <font color="magenta">I had my eyes on her brother’s door,</font>
      which was but ten steps off and which, indescribably, produced in me a
      renewal of the strange impulse that I lately spoke of as my temptation. What
      if I should go straight in and march to <em>his </em>
      window?—what if, by risking to his boyish bewilderment a revelation of my
      motive, I should throw across the rest of the mystery the long halter of my
      boldness?
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="13"><sup>¶13</sup>This thought <font color="teal">held me sufficiently</font> to make
      me cross to his threshold and pause again. I preternaturally listened; I
      figured to myself what might portentously be; I wondered if his bed were
      also empty and <font color="magenta">he too were secretly at watch. </font>
      <font color="sienna">It was a deep, soundless minute,</font> at the end
      of which my impulse failed. <font color="sienna">He was quiet; he might
        be innocent;</font> the risk was hideous; I turned away. There was a
      figure in the grounds—<font color="magenta">a figure prowling for a
        sight, </font> the visitor with whom Flora was engaged; but it was not the visitor most concerned
      with my boy. <font color="lightpink">I hesitated afresh, but on other grounds and
        only for <font color="Olive">a few seconds</font>; then I had made my choice.
      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="14"><sup>¶14</sup>There were empty rooms at Bly, and it was only a question of choosing the right one. The
      right one suddenly presented itself to me as the lower one—though high above
      the gardens—in the solid corner of the house that I have spoken of as the
      old tower. This was a large, square chamber, arranged with some state as a
      bedroom, the extravagant size of which made it so inconvenient that it had
      not for <font color="GreenYellow">years</font>, though kept by Mrs.
      Grose in exemplary order, been occupied. I had often admired
      it and I knew my way about in it; I had only, after just faltering at the
      first chill gloom of its disuse, to pass across it <font color="sienna">and unbolt as quietly as I could one of the shutters. </font>
      <font color="sienna">Achieving this transit, I uncovered the glass
        without a sound</font> and, applying my face to the pane, was able, <font color="magenta">the darkness without being much less than within,
        to see that I commanded the right direction. Then I saw something more.
        The moon made the night extraordinarily penetrable and showed me on the
        lawn a person, diminished by distance, who stood there motionless and as
        if fascinated, looking up to where I had appeared—looking, that is, not
        so much straight at me as at something that was apparently above
        me.</font> There was clearly another person above me—there was a person
      on the tower; but the presence on the lawn was not in the least what I had
      conceived and had confidently hurried to meet. The presence on the lawn—I
      felt sick as I made it out—was poor little Miles himself.

    <h3>Chapter: 11</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>It was not till <font color="GreenYellow">late next day</font> that I spoke to Mrs. Grose; <font color="magenta">the
        rigor with which I kept my pupils in sight </font> making it often
      difficult to meet her privately, and the more as we each felt the importance
      of not provoking—on the part of the servants quite as much as on that of the
      children—any suspicion of a secret flurry or that of a discussion of
      mysteries. <font color="magenta">I drew a great security in this
        particular from her mere smooth aspect. There was nothing in her fresh
        face to pass on to others my horrible confidences. </font> She believed
      me, I was sure, absolutely: if she hadn’t I don’t know what would have
      become of me, for I couldn’t have borne the business alone. But she was a
      magnificent monument to the blessing of a want of imagination, <font color="magenta">and if she could see in our little charges </font>
      nothing but their beauty and amiability, their happiness and cleverness, she
      had no direct communication with the sources of my trouble. <font color="magenta">If they had been at all visibly blighted or
        battered, </font> she would doubtless have grown, on tracing it back,
      haggard enough to match them; as matters stood, however, I could feel her,
      <font color="magenta">when she surveyed them,</font> with her large
      white arms folded <font color="magenta">and the habit of serenity in all her look,</font>
      thank the Lord’s mercy that if they were ruined the pieces would still
      serve. Flights of fancy gave place, in her mind, <font color="maroon">to a steady
        fireside glow,</font> and I had already begun to perceive how, with the
      development of the conviction that—as time went on without a public
      accident—our young things could, after all, look out for themselves, she
      addressed her greatest solicitude to the sad case presented by their
      instructress. That, for myself, was a sound simplification: I could engage
      that, to the world, <font color="magenta">my face should tell no
        tales,</font> but it would have been, in the conditions, an immense added
      strain to find myself anxious about hers.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>
      <font color="Olive">At the hour</font> I now speak of she had joined me, under pressure, on
      the terrace, where, with the lapse of the <font color="GreenYellow">season</font>,
      the afternoon sun was now agreeable; and we sat there together while, before
      us, at a distance, but within call if we wished, the children strolled to
      and fro in one of their most manageable moods. They moved slowly, in unison,
      below us, over the lawn, the boy, as they went, <font color="lime">reading aloud from a storybook</font> and <font color="teal">passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in touch. </font>
      <font color="magenta">Mrs. Grose
        watched them with positive placidity;</font> then I caught the <font color="sienna">suppressed intellectual creak with which she
        conscientiously turned to take from me a view of the back of the
        tapestry. </font> I had made her a receptacle of lurid things, but there
      was an odd recognition of my superiority—my accomplishments and my
      function—in her patience under my pain. She offred her mind to my
      disclosures as, had I wished to mix a witch’s broth and proposed it with
      assurance, she would have held out a large clean saucepan. This had become
      thoroughly her attitude by the time that, in my recital of the events of
      <font color="Olive">the night</font>, I reached the point of what Miles had said to me when, <font color="magenta">after seeing him, at such a monstrous hour, almost
        on the very spot where he happened now to be, </font> I had gone down to
      bring him in; choosing then, at the window, with a concentrated need of not
      alarming the house, rather that method than a signal more resonant. I had
      left her meanwhile in little doubt of my small hope of representing with
      success even to her actual sympathy my sense of the real splendor of the
      little inspiration with which, after I had got him into the house, the boy
      met my final articulate challenge. <font color="magenta">As soon as I
        appeared in the moonlight on the terrace, he had come to me as straight
        as possible; </font>
      <font color="teal">on which I had taken his hand without a word and
        led him, through the dark spaces, up the staircase where Quint had so hungrily hovered for him,
      </font> along the lobby <font color="sienna">where I had listened and
        trembled, and so to his forsaken room.</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup>
      <font color="sienna">Not a sound, on the way, had passed between
        us,</font> and I had wondered—oh, <em>how</em> I had
      wondered!—<font color="teal">if he were groping about in his
        little mind for something plausible and not too grotesque. </font> It
      would tax his invention, certainly, and I felt, this time, over his real
      embarrassment, a curious thrill of triumph. It was a sharp trap for the
      inscrutable! He couldn’t play any longer at innocence; so how the deuce
      would he get out of it? There beat in me indeed, with the passionate throb
      of this question an equal dumb appeal as to how the deuce <em>I</em> should. I was confronted at last, as never yet,
      with all the risk attached even now to sounding my own horrid note. I
      remember in fact that as we pushed into his little chamber, where the bed
      had not been slept in at all and the window, uncovered to the moonlight,
      made the place so clear that there was no need of striking a match—I
      remember how I suddenly dropped, sank upon the edge of the bed from the
      force of the idea that he must know how he really, as they say, “had” me. He
      could do what he liked, with all his cleverness to help him, so long as I
      should continue to defer to the old tradition of the criminality of those
      caretakers of the young who minister to superstitions and fears. He “had” me
      indeed, and in a cleft stick; for who would ever absolve me, who would
      consent that I should go unhung, if, by the faintest tremor of an overture,
      I were the first to introduce into our perfect intercourse an element so
      dire? No, no: it was useless to attempt to convey to Mrs. Grose, just as it is scarcely less so to
      attempt to suggest here, <font color="teal">how, in our short, stiff
        brush in the dark, he fairly shook me with admiration. </font> I was of
      course thoroughly kind and merciful; <font color="teal">never, never
        yet had I placed on his little shoulders hands of such tenderness as
        those with which, while I rested against the bed, I held him there well </font>
      <font color="maroon">under fire.</font> I had no alternative but, in form at
      least, to put it to him.

    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>It was all very well to join them, but speaking to them proved quite as much
      as ever an effort beyond my strength—offered, in close quarters,
      difficulties as insurmountable as before. This situation continued <font color="GreenYellow">a
        month</font>, and with new aggravations and particular notes, the note
      above all, sharper and sharper, of the small ironic consciousness on the
      part of my pupils. It was not, I am as sure <font color="GreenYellow">today</font> as I was sure
      then, my mere infernal imagination: it was absolutely traceable that they
      were aware of my predicament and that this strange relation made, in a
      manner, for a long time, the air in which we moved. I don’t mean that they
      had their tongues in their cheeks or did anything vulgar, for that was not
      one of their dangers: I do mean, on the other hand, that the element of the
      unnamed and untouched became, between us, greater than any other, and that
      so much avoidance could not have been so successfully effected without a
      great deal of tacit arrangement. <font color="magenta">It was as if,
        at moments, we were perpetually coming into sight of subjects before
        which we must stop short, turning suddenly out of alleys that we
        perceived to be blind, </font>
      <font color="sienna">
        <font color="sienna">closing with a little
          bang that made us look at each other—for, like all bangs, it was
          something louder than we had intended—the doors we had indiscreetly
          opened.</font>
      </font> All roads lead to Rome, and there were times
      when it might have struck us that almost every branch of study or subject of
      conversation skirted forbidden ground. Forbidden ground was the question of
      the return of the dead in general and of whatever, in especial, might
      survive, in memory, of the friends little children had lost. There were days
      when I could have sworn that one of them had, with a small invisible nudge,
      said to the other: “She thinks she’ll do it this time—but she <em>won’t!</em>” To “do it” would have been to
      indulge for instance—and for once in a way—in some direct reference to the
      lady who had prepared them for my discipline. They had a delightful endless
      appetite for passages in my own history, to which I had again and again
      treated them; they were in possession of everything that had ever happened
      to me, had had, with every circumstance the story of my smallest adventures
      and of those of my brothers and sisters and of the cat and the dog at home,
      as well as many particulars of the eccentric nature of my father, of the
      furniture and arrangement of our house, and of the conversation of the old
      women of our village. There were things enough, taking one with another, to
      chatter about, if one went very fast and knew by instinct when to go round.
      They pulled with an art of their own the strings of my invention and my
      memory; <font color="magenta">and nothing else perhaps, when I
        thought of such occasions afterward, gave me so the suspicion of being
        watched from under cover. </font> It was in any case over <em>my</em> life, <em>my</em> past, and
      <em>my </em> friends alone that we could take
      anything like our ease—a state of affairs that led them sometimes without
      the least pertinence to break out into sociable reminders. I was
      invited—with no visible connection—to repeat afresh Goody Gosling’s
      celebrated <em><em>mot</em></em> or to confirm the details already supplied as to the cleverness
      of the vicarage pony.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>It was partly at such junctures as these and partly at quite different ones
      that, with the turn my matters had now taken, my predicament, as I have
      called it, grew most sensible. The fact that the days passed for me without
      another encounter ought, it would have appeared, to have done something
      toward soothing my nerves. <font color="teal">Since the light brush,
        that <font color="GreenYellow">second night</font> on the upper landing, of the presence of
        a woman at the foot of the stair, </font>
      <font color="magenta">I had seen nothing, whether in or out of the
        house, that one had better not have seen. </font> There was many a corner
      round which I expected to come upon Quint, and many a situation that, in a merely sinister way,
      would have favored the appearance of Miss
      Jessel. <font color="GreenYellow">The summer had turned, the summer
        had gone</font>; the autumn had dropped upon Bly and had blown out half our lights. The place, with its <font color="gray">gray </font> sky and withered garlands, its bared
      spaces and scattered dead leaves, was like a theater after the
      performance—all strewn with crumpled playbills. There were exactly states of
      the air, conditions of sound and of stillness, unspeakable impressions of
      the <em>kind</em> of ministering moment, that brought
      back to me, <font color="teal">long enough to catch it,</font> the
      feeling of the medium in which, that <font color="GreenYellow">June</font> evening
      out of doors, <font color="magenta">I had had my first sight of
        Quint, and in which, too, at
        those other instants, I had, after seeing him through the window, looked
        for him in vain in the circle of shrubbery. </font>
      <font color="mediumblue">I recognized the signs, the portents—I
        recognized the moment, the spot. </font> But they remained unaccompanied
      and empty, and I continued unmolested; if unmolested one could call a young
      woman whose sensibility had, in the most extraordinary fashion, not declined
      but deepened. I had said in my talk with Mrs.
      Grose on that horrid scene of Flora’s by the lake—and had perplexed her by so saying—that
      it would from that moment distress me much more to lose my power than to
      keep it. I had then expressed what was vividly in my mind: the truth that,
      <font color="magenta">whether the children really saw or not—since,
        that is, it was not yet definitely proved—I greatly preferred, as a
        safeguard, the fullness of my own exposure. </font> I was ready to know
      the very worst that was to be known. What I had then had an ugly glimpse of
      was that <font color="magenta">my eyes might be sealed</font> just
      while theirs were most opened. <font color="mistyrose">Well, my eyes <em>were</em> sealed, </font> it appeared, at present—a
      consummation for which it seemed blasphemous not to thank God. There was,
      alas, a difficulty about that: I would have thanked him with all my soul had
      I not had in a proportionate measure this conviction of the secret of my
      pupils. How can I retrace <font color="GreenYellow">today</font> the strange steps of my
      obsession? There were times of our being together when I would have been
      ready to swear that, literally, in my presence, but with my direct sense of
      it closed, they had visitors who were known and were welcome. Then it was
      that, had I not been deterred by the very chance that such an injury might
      prove greater than the injury to be averted, my exultation would have broken
      out. <font color="Indigo">“They’re here, they’re here, you
        little wretches,” </font> I would have cried, <font color="Indigo">“and you can’t deny it now!”</font>. <font color="mistyrose">The little wretches </font> denied it with all the added volume of their
      sociability and their tenderness, in just the crystal depths of which—like
      the flash of a fish in a stream—the mockery of their advantage peeped up.
      The shock, in truth, had sunk into me still deeper than I knew on the night
      when, <font color="magenta">looking out to see either Quint or Miss
        Jessel under the stars, </font> I had beheld the boy over
      whose rest I watched and who had immediately brought in with him—had
      straightway, there, turned it on me—the lovely upward look with which, from
      the battlements above me, the hideous apparition of Quint had played. If it was a question of a
      scare, my discovery on this occasion had scared me more than any other, and
      it was in the condition of nerves produced by it that I made my actual
      inductions. They harassed me so that sometimes, at odd moments, <font color="sienna">I shut myself up audibly to rehearse—it was at once
        a fantastic relief and a renewed despair—the manner in which I might
        come to the point. </font> I approached it from one side and the other
      while, in my room, I flung myself about, but I always broke down in the
      monstrous utterance of names. As they died away on my lips, I said to myself
      that I should indeed help them to represent something infamous, if, by
      pronouncing them, I should violate as rare a little case of instinctive
      delicacy as any schoolroom, probably, had ever known. When I said to myself:
      <font color="Indigo">“<em>They</em>
        have the manners to be silent, and you, trusted as you are, the baseness
        to speak!” </font> I felt myself <font color="crimson">crimson</font>
      and <font color="teal">I covered my face with my hands. </font>
      <font color="sienna">After these secret scenes I chattered more than
        ever, going on volubly enough till one of our prodigious, palpable
        hushes occurred—I can call them nothing else—the strange, dizzy lift or
        swim (I try for terms!) into a stillness, a pause of all life, that had
        nothing to do with the more or less noise that at the moment we might be
        engaged in making and that I could hear through any deepened
        exhilaration or quickened recitation or louder strum of the piano.
      </font> Then it was that the others, the outsiders, were there. Though they
      were not angels, they “passed,” as the French say, causing me, while they
      stayed, to tremble with the fear of their addressing to their younger
      victims some yet more infernal message or more vivid image than they had
      thought good enough for myself.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup>What it was most impossible to get rid of was the cruel idea that, <font color="magenta">whatever I had seen, </font>
      <font color="magenta">Miles and Flora saw <em>more</em>—things terrible and unguessable </font> and that sprang from
      dreadful passages of intercourse in the past. Such things naturally left on
      the surface, for the time, a chill which we vociferously denied that we
      felt; and we had, all three, with <font color="mistyrose">repetition</font>,
      got into such splendid training that we went, each time, almost
      automatically, to mark the close of the incident, through the very same
      movements. It was striking of the children, at all events, to kiss me
      inveterately with a kind of wild irrelevance and never to fail—one or the
      other—of the precious question that had helped us through many a peril.
      <font color="Periwinkle">“When do you think
        he _will_ come? Don’t you think <font color="bisque">we <em>ought</em> to write?” </font>
      </font> —there was nothing like that inquiry, we found by experience, for
      carrying off an awkwardness. “He” of course was their uncle
      in Harley Street; and we lived in much profusion of theory that he might at any
      moment arrive to mingle in our circle. It was impossible to have given less
      encouragement than he had done to such a doctrine, but if we had not had the
      doctrine to fall back upon we should have deprived each other of some of our
      finest exhibitions. <font color="purple">He never wrote to
        them</font>—that may have been selfish, but it was a part of the flattery of
      his trust of me; for the way in which a man pays his highest tribute to a
      woman is apt to be but by the more festal celebration of one of the sacred
      laws of his comfort; and I held that I carried out the spirit of the pledge
      given not to appeal to him <font color="bisque">when I let my charges
        understand that their own letters were but charming literary exercises.
        They were too beautiful to be posted; I kept them myself; I have them
        all to this hour. </font> This was a rule indeed which only added to the
      satiric effect of my being plied with the supposition that he might at any
      moment be among us. It was exactly as if my charges knew how almost more
      awkward than anything else that might be for me. <font color="magenta">There appears to me, moreover, as I look back,
      </font> no note in all this more extraordinary than the mere fact that, in
      spite of my tension and of their triumph, I never lost patience with them.
      Adorable they must in truth have been, I now reflect, that I didn’t in these
      days hate them! Would exasperation, however, if relief had longer been
      postponed, finally have betrayed me? It little matters, for relief arrived.
      I call it relief, though it was only the relief that a snap brings to a
      strain or the burst of a thunderstorm to a day of suffocation. It was at
      least change, and it came with a rush.

    <h3>Chapter: 14</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>Walking to church a certain <font color="GreenYellow">Sunday</font>
      <font color="Olive">morning</font>, I had little Miles at
      my side and his sister, in advance of us and at Mrs. Grose’s, well in sight. <font color="lightpink">It was a
        crisp, clear day, the first of its order for some time; <font color="Olive">the
          night</font> had brought a touch of frost, and the autumn air,
        bright and sharp, </font> made the church bells almost gay. It was an odd
      accident of thought that I should have happened at such a moment to be
      particularly and very gratefully struck with the obedience of my little
      charges. Why did they never resent my inexorable, my perpetual society?
      Something or other had brought nearer home to me <font color="teal">that I had all but pinned the boy to my shawl and that, </font> in the
      way our companions were marshaled before me, I might have appeared to
      provide against some danger of rebellion. <font color="magenta">
        <font color="magenta">I was like a gaoler with an eye to possible
          surprises and escapes.</font>
      </font> But all this belonged—I mean
      their magnificent little surrender—just to the special array of the facts
      that were most abysmal. Turned out for <font color="GreenYellow">Sunday</font> by his uncle’s
      tailor, who had had a free hand and a notion of pretty waistcoats and of his
      grand little air, Miles’s whole title to
      independence, the rights of his sex and situation, were so stamped upon him
      that if he had suddenly struck for freedom I should have had nothing to say.
      I was by the strangest of chances wondering how I should meet him when the
      revolution unmistakably occurred. I call it a revolution because <font color="magenta">I now see how, </font> with the word he spoke,
      the curtain rose on the last act of my dreadful drama, and the catastrophe
      was precipitated. <font color="Goldenrod"> “Look
        here, my dear, you know,” </font> he charmingly said, <font color="Goldenrod">“when in the world, please, am I going
        back to school?” </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>
      <font color="whitesmoke">Transcribed here the speech sounds harmless enough,</font>
      <font color="sienna">particularly as uttered in the sweet, high, casual
        pipe with which, at all interlocutors, but above all at his eternal governess, he threw off
        intonations as if he were tossing roses. </font>
      <font color="teal">There was something in them that always made one
        “catch,” and I caught, </font> at any rate, now so effectually that I
      stopped as short as if one of the trees of the park had fallen across the
      road. There was something new, on the spot, between us, and he was perfectly
      aware that I recognized it, though, toenable me to do so, he had no need to
      look a whit less candid and charming than usual. I could feel in him how he
      already, from my at first finding nothing to reply, perceived the advantage
      he had gained. I was so slow to find anything that he had plenty of time,
      after <font color="Olive">a minute</font>, to continue with his suggestive but
      inconclusive smile: <font color="Goldenrod">“You
        know, my dear, that for a fellow to be with a lady <em>always</em>—!” </font> His “my dear” was
      constantly on his lips for me, and nothing could have expressed more the
      exact shade of the sentiment with which I desired to inspire my pupils than
      its fond familiarity. It was so respectfully easy.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup>But, oh, how I felt that at present I must pick my own phrases! I remember

      </font> We had <font color="magenta">arrived within sight of the
        church</font> and of various persons, including several of the household
      of Bly, on their way to it and clustered about the door to see us go
      in. I quickened our step; I wanted to get there before the question between
      us opened up much further; I reflected hungrily that, <font color="Olive">for more than an
        hour</font>, he would have to be silent; and I thought with envy of the
      comparative <font color="Olive">dusk</font> of the pew and of the almost spiritual help of
      the hassock on which I might bend my knees. I seemed literally to be running
      a race with some confusion to which he was about to reduce me, but I felt
      that he had got in first when, before we had even entered the churchyard, he
      threw out— <font color="Goldenrod">“I want my own
        sort!”</font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="28"><sup>¶28</sup>It literally made me bound forward. <font color="Indigo">“There are not many of <font color="mistyrose"> your own

      leaving his thought so unfinished that, after we had come into the gate,
      another stop, <font color="teal">which he imposed on me by the
        pressure of his arm, </font> had become inevitable. Mrs. Grose and Flora had passed into the church, the other worshippers had
      followed, and we were, for <font color="Olive">the minute</font>, alone among the old,
      thick graves. We had paused, on the path from the gate, by a low, oblong,
      tablelike tomb.

    <h3>Chapter: 15</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>The business was practically settled from the moment I never followed him. It
      was a pitiful surrender to agitation, but my being aware of this had somehow
      no power to restore me. I only sat there on my tomb and <font color="lime">read into what my little friend had said to me
        the fullness of its meaning; </font> by the time I had grasped the whole
      of which I had also embraced, for absence, the pretext that I was ashamed to
      offer my pupils and the rest of the congregation such an example of delay.
      What I said to myself above all was that Miles had got something out of me and that the proof of it,
      for him, would be just this awkward collapse. He had got out of me that
      there was something I was much afraid of and that he should probably be able
      to make use of my fear to gain, for his own purpose, more freedom. My fear
      was of having to deal with the intolerable question of the grounds of his
      dismissal from school, for that was really but the question of the horrors
      gathered behind. <font color="lightpink">That his uncle should arrive to treat with
        me of these things was a solution that, strictly speaking, I ought now
        to have desired to bring on; but I could so little face the ugliness and
        the pain of it that I simply procrastinated and lived from hand to
        mouth. </font> The boy, to my deep discomposure, was immensely in the
      right, was in a position to say to me: <font color="Indigo">“Either you clear up with my guardian the mystery of this <font color="mediumpurple"> interruption of my studies, </font> or you
        cease to expect me to lead with you a life that’s so unnatural for a
        boy.” </font> What was so unnatural for the particular boy I was concerned with
      was this sudden revelation of a consciousness and a plan.</div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>That was what really overcame me, what prevented my going in. I walked round
      the church, <font color="lightpink">hesitating, hovering;</font> I reflected that I
      had already, with him, hurt myself beyond repair. Therefore I could patch up
      nothing, <font color="teal">and it was too extreme an effort to
        squeeze beside him into the pew: he would be so much more sure than ever
        to pass his arm into mine and make me sit there for <font color="Olive">an hour</font>
        in close, silent contact with his commentary on our talk. </font> For the
      <font color="Olive">first minute</font> since his arrival I wanted to get away from
      him. <font color="lightpink">As I paused beneath the high east window </font> and
      <font color="sienna">listened to the sounds of worship,</font> I was
      taken with an impulse that might master me, I felt, completely should I give
      it the least encouragement. I might easily put an end to my predicament by
      getting away altogether. Here was my chance; there was no one to stop me; I
      could give the whole thing up—turn my back and retreat. It was only a
      question of hurrying again, for a few preparations, to the house which the
      attendance at church of so many of the servants would practically have left
      unoccupied. No one, in short, could blame me if I should just drive
      desperately off. What was it to get away if I got away only till dinner?
      That would be <font color="Olive">in a couple of hours</font>, at the end of which—I had
      the acute prevision—my little pupils would play at innocent wonder about my
      nonappearance in their train.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup>“What <em>did</em> you do, you naughty, bad thing? Why in the
      world, to worry us so—and take our thoughts off, too, don’t you
      know?—did you desert us at the very door?” <font color="magenta">I couldn’t meet such questions nor, as they asked
        them, their false little lovely eyes; </font> yet it was all so exactly
      what I should have to meet that, as the prospect grew sharp to me, I at last
      let myself go.</div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="4"><sup>¶4</sup>I got, so far as the immediate moment was concerned, away; I came straight
      out of the churchyard and, thinking hard, retraced my steps through the
      park. It seemed to me that by the time I reached the house I had made up my
      mind I would fly. The <font color="GreenYellow">Sunday</font> stillness both of the approaches
      and of the interior, in which I met no one, fairly excited me with a sense
      of opportunity. Were I to get off quickly, this way, I should get off
      without a scene, without a word. My quickness would have to be remarkable,
      however, and the question of a conveyance was the great one to settle.
      Tormented, in the hall, with difficulties and obstacles, I remember sinking
      down at the foot of the staircase—suddenly collapsing there on the lowest
      step and then, with a revulsion, recalling that it was exactly where more
      than <font color="GreenYellow">a month</font> before, <font color="magenta">in the darkness
        of night and just so bowed with evil things, I had seen the specter of
        the most horrible of women. </font> At this I was able to straighten
      myself; I went the rest of the way up; I made, in my bewilderment, for the
      schoolroom, where there were objects belonging to me that I should have to
      take. <font color="magenta">But I opened the door to find again, in a
        flash, my eyes unsealed. </font>
      <font color="magenta">In the presence of what I saw I reeled straight
        back upon my resistance. </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="5"><sup>¶5</sup>Seated at my own table in clear noonday light I saw a person whom, without my
      previous experience, I should have taken at the first blush for some
      housemaid who might have stayed at home to look after the place and who,
      availing herself of rare relief from observation and of the schoolroom <font color="lemonchiffon">table and my pens, ink, and paper, had applied
        herself to the considerable effort of a letter to her sweetheart. </font>
      There was an effort in the way that, while her arms rested on the table, her
      hands with evident weariness supported her head; but at the moment I took
      this in I had already become aware that, in spite of my entrance, her
      attitude strangely persisted. Then it was—with the very act of its
      announcing itself—that her identity flared up in a change of posture. She
      rose, not as if she had heard me, but with an indescribable grand melancholy
      of indifference and detachment, and, within a dozen feet of me, stood there
      as my vile predecessor. Dishonored and tragic, she was all before me; <font color="magenta">
        <font color="teal">but even as I fixed
          and, for memory, secured it, the awful image passed
          away.</font>
      </font> Dark as <font color="Olive">midnight</font> in her <font color="plum">black</font> dress, her haggard beauty and her
      unutterable woe, <font color="magenta">she had looked at me </font> long
      enough to appear to say that her right to sit at my table was as good as
      mine to sit at hers. While these instants lasted, indeed, I had the
      extraordinary chill of feeling that it was I who was the intruder. It was as
      a wild protest against it that, actually addressing her—<font color="Indigo">“You terrible,
        miserable woman!”</font>— <font color="sienna">I heard myself break
        into a sound that, by the open door, rang through the long passage and
        the empty house. </font>
      <font color="magenta">She looked at me</font>
      <font color="sienna">as if she heard me,</font> but I had recovered
      myself and cleared the air. There was nothing in the room the next minute
      but the sunshine and a sense that I must stay.

    <h3>Chapter: 16</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>I had so perfectly expected that the return of my pupils would be marked by a
      demonstration that I was freshly upset at having to take into account that
      they were dumb about my absence. Instead of gaily denouncing and caressing
      me, they made no allusion to my having failed them, and I was left, for the
      time, on perceiving that she too said nothing, to study Mrs. Grose’s odd face. I did this to such
      purpose that I made sure they had in some way bribed her to silence; a
      silence that, however, I would engage to break down on the first private
      opportunity. This opportunity came before tea: I secured <font color="Olive">five
        minutes</font> with her in the housekeeper’s room, where, in the
      twilight, <font color="Peru">amid a smell of lately baked

    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>I went so far, in the evening, as to make a beginning. The weather had

      that moment so fabulous as our actual relation. <font color="Indigo">“Certainly you shall go back to school,”
      </font> I said, <font color="Indigo">“if it be

      <font color="magenta">His clear, listening face, framed in its smooth
        whiteness, made him for the minute as
        appealing as some wistful patient in a children’s hospital; </font> and I
      would have given, as the resemblance came to me, all I possessed on earth
      really to be the nurse or the sister of charity who might have helped to
      cure him. Well, even as it was, I perhaps might help! <font color="Indigo">“Do you know you’ve never said a word to me

      gained time; he waited, he called for guidance. <font color="Goldenrod"> “Haven’t I?” </font> It wasn’t for
      <em>me</em> to help him—it was for the thing I had

    <div class="paragraph" n="18"><sup>¶18</sup>Something in his tone and the expression of his face, as I got this from him,
      set my heart aching with such a pang as it had never yet known; so
      unutterably touching was it to see his little brain puzzled and his little
      resources taxed to play, under the spell laid on him, a part of innocence
      and consistency. <font color="Indigo">“No,
        never—from <font color="Olive">the hour</font> you came back. You’ve never mentioned

          little Miles—no, never</font>—have
        you given me an inkling of anything that <em>may</em>
        have happened there. Therefore you can fancy how much I’m in the dark.
        Until you came out, that way, <font color="Olive">this morning</font>, you had, since
        the <font color="Olive">first hour</font> I saw you, scarce even made a reference to
        anything in your previous life. You seemed so perfectly to accept the
        present.” </font> It was extraordinary how my absolute conviction of his
      secret precocity (or whatever I might call the poison of an influence that I
      dared but half to phrase) made him, in spite of the faint breath of his
      inward trouble, appear as accessible as an older person—imposed him almost
      as an intellectual equal. <font color="Indigo">“I thought you wanted to go on as you are.” </font>

      was instantaneous, but it came in the form of an extraordinary blast and
      chill, a gust of frozen air, and a shake of the room as great as if, in the

    <h3>Chapter: 18</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>
      <font color="GreenYellow">The next day</font>, after lessons, Mrs.
      Grose found a moment to say to me quietly: <font color="Periwinkle">
        <font color="bisque">“Have you written, miss?”</font>
      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>
      <font color="Indigo">
        <font color="bisque">“Yes—I’ve written.”</font>
      </font> But I didn’t add—for <font color="Olive">the hour</font>—that <font color="bisque">my letter, sealed and directed, was still in my pocket. </font> There
      would be time enough to send it before the messenger should go to the
      village. Meanwhile there had been, on the part of my pupils, no more
      brilliant, more exemplary morning. It was exactly as if they had both had at
      heart to gloss over any recent little friction. They performed the dizziest
      feats of arithmetic, soaring quite out of <em>my</em>
      feeble range, and perpetrated, in higher spirits than ever, geographical and
      historical jokes. It was conspicuous of course in Miles in particular that he appeared to wish to show how
      easily he could let me down. This child, to my memory, really lives in a
      setting of beauty and misery that no words can translate; there was a
      distinction all his own in every impulse he revealed; never was a small
      natural creature, <font color="magenta">to the uninitiated eye</font>
      all frankness and freedom, a more ingenious, a more extraordinary little
      gentleman. I had perpetually to guard against the wonder of contemplation
      into which <font color="magenta">my initiated view betrayed me; to
        check the irrelevant gaze </font> and <font color="sienna">discouraged sigh</font> in which I constantly both attacked and
      renounced the enigma of what such a little gentleman could have done that
      deserved a penalty. Say that, by the dark prodigy I knew, the imagination of
      all evil <em> had </em> been opened up to him: all the
      justice within me ached for the proof that it could ever have flowered into
      an act.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup>He had never, at any rate, been such a little gentleman as when, after our
      early dinner on <font color="GreenYellow">this dreadful day</font>, he came round to me and
      asked if I shouldn’t like him, for <font color="Olive">half an hour</font>, to play to me.
      David playing to Saul could never have shown
      a finer sense of the occasion. It was literally a charming exhibition of
      tact, of magnanimity, and quite tantamount to his saying outright: <font color="Indigo">“The true knights we love to read about never push an advantage
        too far. I know what you mean now: you mean that—to be let alone
        yourself and not followed up—you’ll cease to worry and spy upon me,
        won’t keep me so close to you, will let me go and come. Well, I
        ‘come,’ you see—but I don’t go! There’ll be plenty of time for that.
        I do really delight in your society, and I only want to show you
        that I contended for a principle.” </font> It may be imagined whether I resisted this appeal <font color="teal">or failed to accompany him again, hand in hand,
      </font> to the schoolroom. <font color="sienna">He sat down at the old
        piano and played as he had never played; </font> and if there are those
      who think he had better have been kicking a football I can only say that I
      wholly agree with them. For at the end of a time that under his influence I
      had quite ceased to measure, I started up with a strange sense of having
      literally slept at my post. It was after luncheon, <font color="maroon">and by
        the schoolroom fire, </font> and yet I hadn’t really, in the least,
      slept: I had only done something much worse—I had forgotten. Where, all this
      time, was Flora? When I put the question to
      Miles, he played on <font color="Olive">a
        minute</font> before answering and then could only say: <font color="Goldenrod">“Why, my dear, how do <em>I </em> know?” </font> —breaking moreover into a
      happy laugh which, immediately after, as if it were a vocal accompaniment,
      he prolonged into incoherent, extravagant song. I went straight to my room,
      but his sister was not there; then, before going downstairs, <font color="magenta">I looked into several others. </font> As she was
      nowhere about she would surely be with Mrs.
      Grose, whom, in the comfort of that theory, I accordingly
      proceeded in quest of. <font color="mistyrose">I found her where I had found
        her the evening before,</font> but she met my quick challenge with blank,
      scared ignorance. She had only supposed that, after the repast, I had
      carried off both the children; as to which she was quite in her right, <font color="magenta">for it was the very first time I had allowed the
        little girl out of my sight </font> without some special provision. Of
      course now indeed she might be with the maids, so that the immediate thing
      was <font color="magenta">to look for her</font> without an air of
      alarm. This we promptly arranged between us; but when, <font color="Olive">ten minutes
        later</font> and in pursuance of our arrangement, we met in the hall, it
      was only to report on either side that after guarded inquiries we had
      altogether failed to trace her. For <font color="Olive">a minute</font> there, <font color="magenta">apart from observation,</font>
      <font color="sienna">we exchanged mute alarms,</font> and I could feel
      with what high interest my friend returned me all those I had from the first
      given her.

    <h3>Chapter: 19</h3>
    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>We went straight to the lake, as it was called at Bly, and I daresay rightly called, <font color="magenta">
        <font color="magenta">though I reflect that it may in fact
          have been a sheet of water less remarkable than it appeared to my
          untraveled eyes.</font>
      </font> My acquaintance with sheets of water
      was small, and the pool of Bly, at all events on the few occasions of my consenting, under the
      protection of my pupils, to affront its surface in the old flat-bottomed
      boat moored there for our use, had impressed me both with its extent and its
      agitation. The usual place of embarkation was half a mile from the house,
      but I had an intimate conviction that, wherever Flora might be, she was not near home. She had not given me
      the slip for any small adventure, and, since the day of the very great one
      that I had shared with her by the pond, I had been aware, in our walks, of
      the quarter to which she most inclined. This was why I had now given to
      Mrs. Grose’s steps so marked <font color="mistyrose">a direction—a direction </font> that made her, <font color="magenta">when she perceived it, oppose a resistance that
        showed me she was freshly mystified. </font>

      my friend cried, planted so firm that, taking it in, I went straight on
      without her. By the time I reached the pool, however, she was close behind
      me, and I knew that, whatever, to her apprehension, might befall me, the
      exposure of my society struck her as her least danger. <font color="sienna">She exhaled a moan of relief </font> as we at last
      <font color="magenta">came in sight of the greater part of the
        water without a sight of the child. </font>
      <font color="magenta">There was no trace of Flora on that nearer side of the bank where my
        observation of her had been most startling, and none on the opposite
        edge, where, save for a margin of some twenty yards, a thick copse came
        down to the water. </font> The pond, oblong in shape, had a width so
      scant compared to its length that, with its ends out of view it might have
      been taken for a scant river. <font color="magenta">We looked at the
        empty expanse, and then I felt the suggestion of my friend’s eyes.
      </font> I knew what she meant and I replied with a negative headshake.

    <div class="paragraph" n="12"><sup>¶12</sup>

      <font color="magenta">I scanned all the visible shore while Mrs. Grose
        took again,</font> into the queer element I offered her, one of her
      plunges of submission; then I pointed out that the boat might perfectly be
      in a small refuge formed by one of the recesses of the pool, an indentation
      masked, for the hither side, by a projection of the bank and by a clump of
      trees growing close to the water.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="17"><sup>¶17</sup>
      <font color="Periwinkle">“But if the boat’s

    <div class="paragraph" n="18"><sup>¶18</sup>
      <font color="Indigo">“That’s exactly what we

    <div class="paragraph" n="19"><sup>¶19</sup>
      <font color="Periwinkle">“By going all the way

      <font color="Indigo">“Certainly, far as it

        <font color="mistyrose">“Laws!”</font>
      </font> cried my friend again; the chain of my logic was ever too much for
      her. It dragged her at my heels even now, and when we had got halfway
      round—a devious, tiresome process, on ground much broken and by a path
      choked with overgrowth— <font color="lightpink">I paused to give her breath.</font>
      <font color="teal">I sustained her with a grateful arm,</font>
      assuring her that she might hugely help me; and this started us afresh, so
      that in the course of but few minutes more we reached a point from which we
      found the boat to be where I had supposed it. <font color="magenta">It
        had been intentionally left as much as possible out of sight </font> and
      was tied to one of the stakes of a fence that came, just there, down to the
      brink and that had been an assistance to disembarking. <font color="magenta">I recognized, as I looked at the pair of short,
      </font> thick oars, quite safely drawn up, the prodigious character of the
      feat for a little girl; but I had lived, by this time, too long among
      wonders and had panted to too many livelier measures. There was a gate in
      the fence, through which we passed, and that brought us, after a trifling
      interval, more into the open. Then, “There she is!” we both
      exclaimed at once.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="22"><sup>¶22</sup>Flora, a short way off, stood before us on
      the grass and smiled as if her performance was now complete. The next thing
      she did, however, was to stoop straight down and pluck—quite as if it were
      all she was there for—a big, ugly spray of withered fern. I instantly became
      sure she had just come out of the copse. She waited for us, not herself
      taking a step, and I was conscious of the rare solemnity with which we
      presently approached her. <font color="magenta">She smiled and
        smiled,</font> and we met; <font color="sienna">but it was all done
        in a silence by this time flagrantly ominous. </font>Mrs. Grose was the first to break the
      spell: she threw herself on her knees and, <font color="teal">drawing
        the child to her breast, clasped in a long embrace the little tender,
        yielding body. </font>
      <font color="magenta">While this dumb convulsion lasted I could only
        watch it—which I did the more intently when I saw Flora’s face peep at me over our companion’s shoulder.
      </font> It was serious now—the flicker had left it; but it strengthened the
      pang with which I at that moment envied Mrs.
      Grose the simplicity of <em>her </em>
      relation. Still, all this while, nothing more passed between us save that
      Flora had let her foolish fern again
      drop to the ground. <font color="Indigo">
        <font color="Green">What she and I had
          virtually said to each other was that pretexts were useless now.

        she launched me. </font>

    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>Just as in the churchyard with Miles, the

      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>Miss Jessel stood before us on the
      opposite bank exactly as she had stood the other time, and I remember,
      strangely, as the first feeling now produced in me, my thrill of joy at
      having brought on a proof. <font color="mistyrose">She was there, and I was
        justified; she was there, </font> and I was neither cruel nor mad. <font color="mistyrose">She was there for poor scared Mrs. Grose, but she was there most for Flora; </font> and no moment of my monstrous
      time was perhaps so extraordinary as that in which I consciously threw out
      to her—with the sense that, pale and ravenous demon as she was, <font color="teal">she would catch and understand it</font>—an
      inarticulate message of gratitude. She rose erect on the spot my friend and
      I had lately quitted, and there was not, <font color="teal">in all
        the long reach of her desire, an inch of her evil that fell short. </font>
      <font color="magenta">This first vividness of vision and emotion were
        things of <font color="Olive">a few secondsa</font>, during which Mrs. Grose’s dazed blink across to where I
        pointed struck me as a sovereign sign that she too at last saw, just as
        it carried my own eyes precipitately to the child. </font> The revelation
      then of the manner in which Flora was
      affected startled me, in truth, far more than it would have done to find her
      also merely agitated, for direct dismay was of course not what I had
      expected. Prepared and on her guard as our pursuit had actually made her,
      she would repress every betrayal; <font color="teal">and I was
        therefore shaken, </font> on the spot, <font color="magenta">by my
        first glimpse </font> of the particular one for which I had not allowed.
      <font color="magenta">To see her, without a convulsion of her small
        <font color="pink">pink</font> face,
      </font> not even feign to
      glance in the direction of the prodigy I announced, but only, instead of
      that, turn at <em>me</em>
      <font color="magenta">an expression of hard, still gravity, an
        expression absolutely new and unprecedented and that appeared to read
        and accuse and judge me </font> —this was a stroke that somehow converted
      the little girl herself into the very presence that could make me quail.
      <font color="magenta">I quailed even though my certitude that she
        thoroughly saw </font> was never greater than at that instant, and in the
      immediate need to defend myself I called it passionately to witness. <font color="Indigo">“She’s there, you little
        unhappy thing— <font color="mistyrose">there, there, <em>there</em>, and you see her as well as you see me!” </font>
      </font> I had said shortly before to Mrs.
      Grose that she was not at these times a child, but an old,
      old woman, and that description of her could not have been more strikingly
      confirmed than in the way in which, for all answer to this, <font color="magenta">she simply showed me, without a concession, an
        admission, of her eyes, a countenance of deeper and deeper, of indeed
        suddenly quite fixed, reprobation. </font> I was by this time—if I can
      put the whole thing at all together—more appalled at what I may properly
      call her manner than at anything else, though it was simultaneously with
      this that I became aware of having Mrs.
      Grose also, and very formidably, to reckon with. My elder
      companion, the next moment, at any rate, <font color="mistyrose">blotted out
        everything but her own flushed face</font>
      <font color="sienna">and her loud, shocked protest, a burst of high
        disapproval. </font>
      <font color="Periwinkle">“What a dreadful turn,
        to be sure, miss! <font color="magenta">Where on earth do you see
          anything?” </font>
      </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="3"><sup>¶3</sup>
      <font color="teal">I could only grasp her more quickly yet,</font>
      for even while she spoke the hideous plain presence stood undimmed and
      undaunted. It had already lasted <font color="Olive">a minute</font>, and it lasted while
      I continued, <font color="teal">seizing my colleague, quite thrusting
        her at it and presenting her to it, to insist with my pointing hand. </font>
      <font color="Indigo">
        <font color="magenta">
          <font color="mistyrose">“You don’t see her exactly as <em>we </em> see?—you mean to say you don’t

            dearest woman, <em>look</em>—!” </font>
        </font>
      </font>
      <font color="magenta">She looked,</font> even as I did, and gave me,
      <font color="sienna">with her deep groan of negation, repulsion,
        compassion</font>—the mixture with her pity of her relief at her
      exemption—a sense, <font color="teal"> touching to me even then,
        that she would have backed me up if she could. </font> I might well have
      needed that, for with this hard blow of the proof that <font color="magenta">her
        eyes were hopelessly sealed</font> I felt my own situation horribly
      crumble, I felt—<font color="magenta">I saw</font>—my livid predecessor
      press, from her position, on my defeat, and I was conscious, more than all,
      of what I should have from this instant to deal with in the astounding
      little attitude of Flora. <font color="teal">Into this attitude Mrs.
        Grose immediately and violently entered, breaking, even
        while there pierced through my sense of ruin a prodigious private
        triumph, into breathless reassurance. </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="4"><sup>¶4</sup>

        <font color="magenta">“She isn’t there, little lady, and nobody’s

        Miss Jessel’s dead and buried?
      </font>
      <font color="Periwinkle"><em>We</em> know, don’t we, love?” </font> —and she
      appealed, blundering in, to the child. <font color="Periwinkle">“It’s all a mere mistake and a worry and a joke—and
        we’ll go home as fast as we can!” </font>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="5"><sup>¶5</sup>Our companion, on this, had responded with a strange, quick primness of
      propriety, and they were again, with Mrs.
      Grose on her feet, united, as it were, in pained opposition
      to me. <font color="magenta">Flora
        continued to fix me with her small mask of reprobation, </font> and even
      at <font color="Olive">that minute</font> I prayed God to forgive me for<font color="magenta">seeming to see that,</font> as she stood there <font color="teal">holding tight to our friend’s dress, </font> her
      incomparable childish beauty had suddenly failed, had quite vanished. I’ve
      said it already—she was literally, she was hideously, hard; she had turned
      common and almost ugly. <font color="Green">“I
        don’t know what you mean. <font color="mistyrose">I see nobody. I see
          nothing. </font> I never <em>have</em>. I think
        you’re cruel. I don’t like you!” </font> Then, after this deliverance,
      which might have been that of a vulgarly pert little girl in the street, she
      <font color="teal">hugged Mrs.
        Grose more closely and buried in her skirts the dreadful
        little face. </font>
      <font color="sienna">In this position she produced an almost furious
        wail.</font>
      <font color="Green">

      <font color="Green">
        <font color="mistyrose">“From you—from you!”</font>
      </font> she cried.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="8"><sup>¶8</sup>Even Mrs. Grose<font color="magenta">looked across at me dismayed, </font> while I had
      nothing to do but communicate again with the figure that, on the opposite
      bank, without a movement, as rigidly still <font color="teal">as if
        catching, beyond the interval, our voices,</font> was as vividly there
      for my disaster as it was not there for my service. The wretched child had
      spoken exactly as if she had got from some outside source each of her
      stabbing little words, and I could therefore, in the full despair of all I
      had to accept, but sadly shake my head at her. <font color="Indigo">“If I had ever doubted, all my doubt would
        at present have gone. I’ve been living with the miserable truth, and now
        it has only too much closed round me. Of course I’ve lost you: I’ve
        interfered, and you’ve seen— <font color="lime">
          <font color="purple">under
            <em>her</em> dictation”
          </font>
        </font>
      </font>—with which I faced, over the pool again, our infernal witness—
      <font color="Indigo">“the easy and perfect
        way to meet it. I’ve done my best, but I’ve lost you. Goodbye.” </font>
      For Mrs. Grose I had an imperative, an
      almost frantic <font color="Indigo">
        <font color="mistyrose">“Go, go!”</font>
      </font> before which, in infinite distress, <font color="magenta">but
        mutely possessed of the little girl and clearly convinced, in spite of
        her blindness, </font> that something awful had occurred and some
      collapse engulfed us, she retreated, by the way we had come, as fast as she
      could move.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="9"><sup>¶9</sup>Of what first happened when I was left alone I had no subsequent memory. I
      only knew that at the end of, I suppose, a quarter of an hour, <font color="teal">an odorous dampness and roughness, chilling and
        piercing my trouble, had made me understand that I must have thrown
        myself, on my face, on the ground and given way to a wildness of grief.
      </font> I must have lain there long and cried and sobbed, for when I raised
      my head <font color="GreenYellow">the day</font> was almost done.<font color="magenta">I
        got up and looked a moment, through the twilight, </font> at the <font color="gray">gray pool</font> and its blank, haunted edge, and then
      I took, back to the house, my dreary and difficult course. When I reached
      the gate in the fence the boat, to my surprise, was gone, so that I had a
      fresh reflection to make on Flora’s
      extraordinary command of the situation. She passed that night, by the most
      tacit, and I should add, were not the word so grotesque a false note, the
      happiest of arrangements, with Mrs.
      Grose. <font color="magenta">
        <font color="mistyrose">I saw neither of them on my return, but, on the
          other hand, as by an ambiguous compensation, I saw a great deal of
          Miles. </font>
      </font>
      <font color="magenta">
        <font color="mistyrose">I saw</font>
      </font> —I can use no other phrase—so much of him that it was as if it were
      more than it had ever been. No evening I had passed at Bly had the portentous quality of this one; <font color="mistyrose">in spite of which—and in spite also of </font> the deeper depths of
      consternation that had opened beneath my feet—there was literally, in the
      ebbing actual, an extraordinarily <font color="darkgreen">sweet
        sadness.</font> On reaching the house <font color="magenta">I had
        never so much as looked for the boy; </font> I had simply gone straight
      to my room to change what I was wearing and to take in, <font color="magenta">at a glance, </font> much material testimony to
      Flora’s rupture. Her little belongings
      had all been removed. <font color="maroon">When later, by the schoolroom fire,
      </font> I was served with tea by the usual maid, I indulged, on the article
      of my other pupil, in no inquiry whatever. He had his freedom now—<font color="mistyrose">he might have it to the end! Well, he did have it;
      </font> and it consisted—in part at least—of his coming in at <font color="Olive">about eight o’clock</font> and sitting down with me in
      silence. On the removal of the tea things <font color="maroon">I had blown out
        the candles </font> and drawn my chair closer: I was conscious of a
      mortal coldness and felt as if I should never again be warm. <font color="magenta">So, when he appeared, </font>
      <font color="maroon">I was sitting in the glow with my thoughts.</font> He paused
      a moment by the door <font color="magenta">as if to look at me; </font>
      then—as if to share them—<font color="maroon">came to the other side of the
        hearth</font> and sank into a chair. We sat there in absolute stillness;
      yet he wanted, I felt, to be with me.

        Grose, </font> who had come to my bedside with worse news.
      Flora was so markedly feverish that an
      illness was perhaps at hand; she had passed a <font color="Olive">night</font> of extreme
      unrest, a night agitated above all by fears that had for their subject not
      in the least her former, but wholly
      her present, governess. It was not
      against the possible re-entrance of Miss
      Jessel on the scene that she protested—it was conspicuously
      and passionately against mine. I was promptly on my feet of course, and with
      an immense deal to ask; the more that my friend had discernibly now girded
      her loins to meet me once more. This I felt as soon as I had put to her the
      question of her sense of the child’s sincerity as against my own. <font color="Indigo">“She persists in denying

    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>Yet it was when she had got off—and I missed her on the spot—<font color="teal">that the great pinch </font> really came. If I had
      counted on what it would give me to find myself alone with Miles, <font color="magenta">I speedily
        perceived, at least, that it would give me a measure. </font> No
      <font color="Olive">hour</font> of my stay in fact was so assailed with apprehensions
      as that of my coming down to learn that the carriage containing Mrs. Grose and my younger pupil had already
      rolled out of the gates. Now I <em> was</em>, I said to
      myself, face to face with the elements, and for much of the rest of
      <font color="GreenYellow">the day</font>, while I fought my weakness, I could consider that
      I had been supremely rash. It was a tighter place still than I had yet
      turned round in; all the more that, for the first time, <font color="magenta">I could see in the aspect of others a confused
        reflection of the crisis. </font>
      <font color="magenta">What had happened naturally caused them all to
        stare; </font> there was too little of the explained, throw out whatever
      we might, in the suddenness of my colleague’s act. <font color="magenta">The maids and the men looked blank;</font> the
      effect of which on my nerves was an aggravation <font color="magenta">until I saw the necessity of making it a positive aid.</font>
      <font color="teal">It was precisely, in short, by just clutching
        the helm that I avoided total wreck; </font> and I dare say that, to bear
      up at all, I became, that morning, very grand and very dry. I welcomed the
      consciousness that I was charged with much to do, and I caused it to be
      known as well that, left thus to myself, I was quite remarkably firm. I
      wandered with that manner, for <font color="Olive">the next hour</font> or two, all over
      the place and <font color="magenta"> looked, </font> I have no doubt, as
      if I were ready for any onset. So, for the benefit of whom it might concern,
      I paraded with a sick heart.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph" n="2"><sup>¶2</sup>The person it appeared least to concern proved to be, till dinner, little
      Miles himself. My perambulations had
      given me, meanwhile, <font color="magenta">no glimpse of him, </font>
      but they had tended to make more public the change taking place in our
      relation as a consequence of his having at the piano, <font color="GreenYellow">the day
        before</font>, kept me, in Flora’s
      interest, so beguiled and befooled. The stamp of publicity had of course
      been fully given by her confinement and departure, and the change itself was
      now ushered in by our nonobservance of the regular custom of the schoolroom.
      <font color="magenta">He had already disappeared when, on my way
        down, I pushed open his door, and I learned below that he had
        breakfasted—in the presence of a couple of the maids—with Mrs. Grose and his sister. </font> He had
      then gone out, as he said, for a stroll; than which nothing, I reflected,
      <font color="magenta"> could better have expressed his frank view
        of the abrupt transformation of my office. </font> What he would not
      permit this office to consist of was yet to be settled: there was a queer
      relief, at all events—I mean for myself in especial—in the renouncement of
      one pretension. If so much had sprung to the surface, I scarce put it too
      strongly in saying that what had perhaps <font color="mistyrose">sprung</font>
      highest was the absurdity of our prolonging the fiction that I had anything
      more to teach him. It sufficiently stuck out that, by tacit little tricks in
      which even more than myself he carried out the care for my dignity, I had
      had to appeal to him to let me off straining to meet him on the ground of
      his true capacity. He had at any rate his freedom now; <font color="teal">I was never to touch it again;</font>
      <font color="magenta">as I had amply shown,</font> moreover, when, on
      his joining me in the schoolroom the <font color="GreenYellow">previous
        <font color="Olive">night</font>
      </font>, I had uttered, on the subject of the interval
      just concluded, neither challenge nor hint. I had too much, from this
      moment, my other ideas. Yet when he at last arrived, the difficulty of
      applying them, the accumulations of my problem, were brought straight home
      to me by the beautiful little presence on which what had occurred had as
      yet, <font color="magenta">for the eye, dropped neither stain nor

      present I felt afresh—for I had felt it <font color="mistyrose">again and
        again</font>seg&gt;—how my equilibrium depended on the success of my rigid
      <font color="mistyrose">will, the will</font>
      <font color="magenta">to shut my eyes as tight as possible to the
        truth</font> that what I had to deal with was, revoltingly, against
      nature. I could only get on at all by taking “nature” into my confidence and
      my account, by treating my monstrous ordeal <font color="teal">as a
        push in a direction unusual, </font> of course, and unpleasant, but
      demanding, after all, for a fair front, only another turn of the screw of
      ordinary human virtue. No attempt, nonetheless, could well require more tact
      than just this attempt to supply, one’s self, <em>all</em> the nature. How could I put even a little of that article
      into a suppression of reference to what had occurred? How, on the other
      hand, could I make <font color="mistyrose">reference</font> without a new
      plunge into the hideous obscure? Well, a sort of answer, after a time, had
      come to me, and it was so far confirmed as that I was met, incontestably,
      <font color="magenta">by the quickened vision </font> of what was
      rare in my little companion. It was indeed as if he had found even now—as he
      had so often <font color="mistyrose">found</font> at lessons—still some other
      delicate way to ease me off. Wasn’t there light in the fact which, as we
      shared our solitude, broke out with a specious glitter it had never yet
      quite worn?—the fact that (opportunity aiding, precious opportunity which
      had now come) it would be preposterous, with a child so endowed, to forego
      the help one might wrest from absolute intelligence? What had his
      intelligence been given him for but to save him? <font color="teal">Mightn’t one, to reach his mind, risk the stretch of an angular arm
        over his character? </font> It was as if, <font color="magenta">when
        we were face to face in the dining room, he had literally shown me the
        way. </font> The roast mutton was on the table, and I had dispensed with
      attendance. Miles, before he sat down,
      stood a moment with his hands in his pockets and looked at the joint, on
      which he seemed on the point of passing some humorous judgment. But what he
      presently produced was: <font color="Goldenrod">“I
        say, my dear, is she really very awfully ill?” </font>

      too. He settled to his repast with the charming little “table manner” that,
      from <font color="GreenYellow">the day</font> of his arrival, had relieved me of all grossness
      of admonition. Whatever he had been driven from school for, it was not for
      ugly feeding. He was irreproachable, as always, <font color="GreenYellow">today</font>; but he
      was unmistakably more conscious. He was discernibly trying to take for
      granted more things than he found, without assistance, quite easy; <font color="sienna">and he dropped into peaceful silence</font>, while
      he felt his situation. Our meal was of the briefest—mine a vain pretense,
      and I had the things immediately removed. While this was done Miles stood again with his hands in his little
      pockets and his back to me—stood <font color="magenta">and looked out
        of the wide window through which, that other day, I had seen what <font color="teal">pulled me up.</font>

      </font> On this, however, <font color="magenta">he faced to the window
        again</font> and <font color="teal"> presently reached it with
        his vague, restless, cogitating step. </font> He remained there awhile,
      with his forehead against the glass, in contemplation of the stupid shrubs I
      knew and the dull things of <font color="GreenYellow">November</font>. I had always
      my hypocrisy of “work,” behind which, now, I gained the sofa. Steadying
      myself with it there as I had repeatedly done at those moments of torment
      that I have described as the moments of my knowing the children to be given
      to something from which I was barred, I sufficiently obeyed my habit of
      being prepared for the worst. But an extraordinary impression dropped on me
      as I extracted a meaning from the boy’s embarrassed back—none other than the
      impression that I was not barred now. This inference grew in a <font color="Olive">few
        minutes</font> to sharp intensity and seemed bound up with the direct
      perception that it was positively <em>he </em> who was.
      <font color="magenta">The frames and squares of the great window
        were a kind of image, </font> for him, of a kind of failure. <font color="magenta">I felt that I saw him,</font> at any rate, shut in
      or shut out. He was admirable, but not comfortable: I took it in with a
      throb of hope. <font color="magenta">Wasn’t he looking, through the
        haunted pane, for something he couldn’t see?</font>—and wasn’t it the
      first time in the whole business that he had known such a lapse? <font color="mistyrose">The first, the very first:</font> I found it a splendid
      portent. <font color="magenta">It made him anxious, though he watched
        himself; </font> he had been anxious <font color="GreenYellow">all day</font> and, <font color="darkgreen">even while in his usual sweet little manner
      </font> he sat at table, had needed all his small strange genius <font color="lime">to give it a gloss.</font> When he at last turned round to
      meet me, it was almost as if this genius had succumbed. <font color="Goldenrod">“Well, I think I’m glad Bly<font color="mistyrose">agrees with <em>me!</em>”

        charming than the way you take it, for of course if we’re alone together

      just nearly reaching port, a perverse horror of what I was doing. To do it
      in <em>any</em> way was an act of violence, for what did
      it consist of but the obtrusion of the idea of grossness and guilt on a
      small helpless creature who had been for me a revelation of the
      possibilities of beautiful <font color="darkmagenta">intercourse?</font> Wasn’t it base to create for a being so exquisite a

    <div class="paragraph" n="1"><sup>¶1</sup>My sense of how he received this suffered for <font color="Olive">a minute</font> from
      something that I can describe only <font color="teal">as a fierce
        split of my attention—a stroke that at first, as I sprang straight up,

        him close, </font> and, while I just fell for support against the nearest
      piece of furniture, instinctively keeping him with his back to the window.
      The appearance was full upon us that I had already had to deal with here:
      <font color="magenta">Peter
        Quint had come into view like a sentinel before a prison.
        The next thing I saw was that, from outside, he had reached the window,

        offered once more to the room his white
        face of damnation. </font>

      horror of the immediate presence that the act would be, <font color="magenta">
        <font color="mistyrose">seeing and facing what I saw and faced, </font>
      </font> to keep the boy himself unaware. The inspiration—I can call it by no

        saw him, from the midst of my act, meet it with a divination, and on the

Somehow—not exactly sure how—I managed to forget how incredibly rich this text is and this is not even to mention the rich secondary criticism produced by this short little novella. Inspired—once again—by some posts from Jonathan Reeve over at Columbia (specifically, his nice <a href="https://jonreeve.com/2017/06/henry-james-sentence/">write-up</a> about sentence lengths in James along with his <a href="https://jonreeve.com/2016/01/non-linear-garden-party/">encoded .xml version</a> of Katherine Mansfield&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Garden Party&rdquo;), I figured I could spend a little bit of time encoding James&rsquo;s story. An early version of the text with all the necessary TEI nuts and bolts is available <a href="https://jonreeve.com/2016/01/non-linear-garden-party/">here</a>. I still need to beautify and format things a bit, but, as I say, the skeleton is there for anyone that might want to <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/henry_james">fork and utilize it</a> for further annotations. I should also say that Kate Singer&rsquo;s really wonderful <a href="https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/digital-close-reading-tei-for-teaching-poetic-vocabularies/">essay</a>, &ldquo;Digital Close Reading: TEI for Teaching Poetic Vocabularies,&rdquo; in <em>The Journal of Interactive Technology &amp; Pedagogy</em>, has served as further inspiration. Her and her students&rsquo; use of the <code>&lt;seg ana&gt;</code> <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-seg.html">TEI tag</a> to include semantic/analytical tags was incredibly useful as my encoding was interested in trying to keep track of the story&rsquo;s clear obsession with sight and vision (there are tags related to the use of the five senses in both figurative and literal/physical form)—an obsession that Shoshana Felman&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2930436?seq=1">canonical essay</a>, &ldquo;Turning the Screw of Interpretation,&rdquo; did yeoman&rsquo;s work charting out for all of us who came after.</p>
<p>There is still much more to be added here—most of the time so far was spent on getting all the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags set up with chapters and paragraphs properly tagged and enumerated—along with properly tagging all the dialogue. In a really haphazard way I tried to attend to some of the semantic annotations I wanted to get into the encoding, but, as I say, it&rsquo;s really haphazard and not at all really standardized and extensive or complete. I should mention, with regards to the dialogue, that it was fun to be able to actually <em>encode</em> how profoundly ambiguous so much of the dialogue is—especially in the prologue. I have <code>&lt;said&gt;</code> tags in the text where it&rsquo;s not clear to me at all precisely who is speaking. We know there are multiple women that pose questions to Douglas in the &ldquo;Prologue,&rdquo; but James does not attribute them nor does he name some of the women (Mrs. Griffin gets named, but the other women do not). For some reason that I can&rsquo;t quite totally explain, I find it really fascinating how this whole process can very explicitly <em>(en)code the ambiguity in the text</em> in this way that is, ironically, quite clear and &ldquo;easy to see&rdquo; (I use that last phrase very guardedly in this context, obviously). We all know this is one of the key techniques in James&rsquo;s production of a sense of uncanniness in the story, but, again, it is indeed intriguing to be able to encode this technique in an explicit way.</p>
<p>Seasoned readers within psychoanalysis and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny">Freud&rsquo;s work</a> are also very aware of the power of repetition within the production of <a href="https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/freud1.pdf">&ldquo;uncanniness&rdquo;</a>. I also tried to keep track of many of the semantic instances of &ldquo;repetition&rdquo; (with the <code>&lt;seg ana='repetition'&gt;</code> tag) along with other forms (i.e. when one characters &ldquo;echoes&rdquo; the words of another or just brutally repeats their interlocutor&rsquo;s words back to them, a rather frequent little tic that arises between the governess and Mrs. Grose). I also tried to play around a little bit with actually counting the number of repeated words within the text as a whole (the script for that is in the aforementioned repo, direct link <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/henry_james/blob/main/main_james_script.py">here</a>). There are functions in that script to count repeated lemmas within a bunch of different &ldquo;ranges&rdquo;—so, one can figure out how often a particular lemma is repeated within five or ten or fifty or one-hundred tokens, thus giving one a sense of how often characters are repeating an individual lemma (not to mention the number of times such repetitions occur within the governess&rsquo; narrative—as a side note, it would be curious to see if most of the repetitions occur <em>within</em> dialogue tags or if a good deal of them happen in the governess&rsquo; non-dialogue-narrative, my sense is that most of the repetitions do occur within dialogue, though I haven&rsquo;t checked or verified that—although now that the text has all the dialogue tagged, this process should be a pretty simple of parsing the .xml tree).</p>
<p>I am not sure that there is anything profoundly new that has surfaced through/from this process—although it has definitely given me a new lens through which to read and think about this story. All the elements mentioned so far are ones that are quite legible just from a normal/traditional close reading of the text; that said, it gives another way to see things, which I find quite fascinating. I am enthusiastic about seeing what one might want to add in terms of the annotation tags. I plan to fleshing out more of the tags associated with the senses, vision, touch, etc. (one should not skimp on the mentions of things having to do with touch—both literally/physically and in a figurative way—as there are numerous instances where the governess &ldquo;takes hold of&rdquo; someone physically [Mrs. Grose quite often, in fact]). The sense of touch is quite significant (I&rsquo;m sure someone in the secondary criticism has covered this, so I&rsquo;m hesitant to claim any originality here whatsoever) within this story.</p>
<p>More work with regards to some of the counting of repetitions—perhaps something including a use of the whole ngram tools—could allow for further thinking about precisely how we might want to count these syntactic/linguistic repetitions.</p>
<p>More to come, to be sure.</p>

<p>His video laying out the steps for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPgQH5UTC9k">&ldquo;Binary Data Classification&rdquo;</a> was clear and quite clarifying for me in all kinds of ways. The classifier&rsquo;s job in this video was to see if it could tell the difference between the work of Oscar Wilde and Dan Brown. What if we tried a different pair of authors/texts? As I offhandedly mentioned in my previous <a href="https://kspicer80.github.io/posts/2022-03-29-vector-space-models-and-shakespeare/">post</a>, finding texts in the public domain (like Shakespeare&rsquo;s for example), saves one quite a bit of time wrangling things together. I also, for some, reason, have found myself going back to some of the works of Willa Cather (admittedly, she&rsquo;s definitely not in my wheelhouse/field of study by any stretch of the imagination) and was wondering how a machine learning classifier might perform when looking at Cather&rsquo;s texts alongside those of one of her key influences, Sarah Orne Jewett (image below is courtesy of UNL&rsquo;s fantastic <em>Willa Cather Archive</em> <a href="https://cather.unl.edu/writings/books/0017">here</a>):</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_10/o_pioneers_1913_dedication_to_jewett.png" alt="Cather Dedication to Jewett 1913"></p>
<p>Why not?—I figured I could tinker around a bit to see what&rsquo;s possible. Project Gutenberg has a number of texts by both <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/22">Cather</a> and <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/202">Jewett</a>—and the UNL <em>Willa Cather Archive</em> has a good number of her texts <a href="https://cather.unl.edu/writings/books">formatted in .xml</a>. I grabbed as many of the texts from these two sources. Since the Gutenberg texts come with the typical boilerplate material at the start and end of the plain text file I pulled out a nice little script from <a href="https://github.com/c-w/gutenberg">&ldquo;C-W&rdquo; on GitHub</a> that had a nice list of phrases used in the boilerplate material; <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/authorship_attribution_studies/blob/main/cather_jewett/strip_headers_and_footers.py">the simple script</a> would strip all the boilerplate when the text files get read in.</p>
<p>The major steps here for this tinkering is to read in all the plain text files, split everything up by sentences, write a function that will &ldquo;pad&rdquo; the data so that any sentences that are less than a specific length ultimately get a <code>?</code> added to the sentence to bring it&rsquo;s length up to the already specified <code>max_length</code> of each sentence. This is due to the way that the keras library likes to have data fed to it. That function looks as follows:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the tutorial, Mattingly uses a max_length of 25 words; a quick graph of the average sentence lengths for each of our author&rsquo;s texts would suggest that number is probably not a bad choice for our dataset:</p>

<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_10/cather_mean_sentence_lengths.png" alt="Cather&amp;rsquo;s Average Sentence Lengths"></p>
<p>We also need to label all of the sentences so we can keep all the sentences and words by Cather paired up together with all the sentences and words by Jewett:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">label_data</span>(sentences, label):

I quite enjoy her <a href="https://cather.unl.edu/writings/shortfiction/ss006">short story</a>, &ldquo;Paul&rsquo;s Case: A Study in Temperament.&rdquo; The script will read in the text, utilize the <code>word_index.json</code> file to replace each word with the number of that word in the index. One can then keep track of each sentence to see the model&rsquo;s predictions: a score close to <code>0</code> suggests the model thinks it&rsquo;s by Cather; the closer to <code>1</code>, the prediction is that it belongs to Jewett. (The full test log <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/authorship_attribution_studies/blob/main/cather_jewett/logging_predictions/test_log_file.txt">file</a> from the console is available here.) We could easily write <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/authorship_attribution_studies/blob/main/cather_jewett/interpreting_model_results/model_results_to_df.py">a little bit of code</a> as well to get the .txt file with all the predictions into a DataFrame for even further analysis; it&rsquo;s relatively quick and simple to get some nice scatter plots of the predictions for each and every sentence in the story:</p>

<p>Most of the sentences are predicted to be by Cather. Curiously, feeding the model a text by Jewett, &ldquo;A Mate of the Daylight,&rdquo; most of the predictions are towards the Cather side of the graph:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_10/model_predictions_scatter_for_mate.png" alt="Predictions for &amp;ldquo;Mate&amp;rdquo;"></p>
<p>It would no doubt be good to do a little bit of digging here to see what might be going on with the model&rsquo;s predictions about this Jewett story. Also, hopefully, in the near future, I can do a little bit of writing about some of the other classifiers one could build and set to work on these Cather and Jewett texts.</p>

<p>Much of the toe-dipping into this new DH field I&rsquo;ve been doing as of late has centered around learning many of the kinds of projects carried out and then turning the methods within those projects onto mew artifacts. A while back I worked my way through Folgert Karsdorp, Mike Kestemont, and Allen Riddell&rsquo;s <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691172361/humanities-data-analysis"><em>Humanities Data Analysis: Case Studies with Python</em></a>. I found a great deal of it thought-provoking and fascinating—especially the chapters devoted to modeling texts with vector spaces and the later chapter on stylometry, which focused on some texts by Hildegard of Bingen and Bernard of Clairvaux. With regards to the first vector space angle, a good deal of very old and dusty linear algebra from my undergraduate days has been rattling around in my head as of late—and it was quite fun to see if I could get any of the old gears turning again (some I definitely could, others will need a bit more grease to get things moving once more).</p>
<p>Chapter 3 of <em>Humanities Data Analysis</em> focused on visually &ldquo;mapping&rdquo; a number of different genres of plays from classical French theater, utilizing some vector space math. I wondered what things would look like if we turned these methods on some of Shakespeare&rsquo;s works. All the plays Karsdorp, et. al. were working with were in .xml format—and after learning how much time the data analyst working on just getting data into a form and structure (&ldquo;preprocessing&rdquo; that is ready for analytic work in the first place, it seemed easy enough to simply grab the bard&rsquo;s texts from <em>The Folger Shakespeare</em>, especially since one can get them all in <a href="https://tei-c.org/tag/tei-simple/">TEI Simple</a> <a href="https://shakespeare.folger.edu/download-the-folger-shakespeare-complete-set/">.xml format</a>—which makes all the plays incredibly easy to parse since all the work of encoding has been done for one already. As most readers of Shakespeare know, his work has often been carved up into similar genres categories to the one&rsquo;s Karsdorp, et. al. were using on their French theater corpus—i.e. into comedies, tragedies, tragicomedy, etc. So I figured I could try something similar with this different corpus.</p>
<p>After grabbing the TEI texts from Folger, we could get some libraries imported and then create some lists with genres and the plays that belong to those genres (it&rsquo;s a little rough, but I simply used the age-old &ldquo;comedy/history/tragedy/late romance&rdquo; categories).</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Karsdorp, et. al., following <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13019">Schöch</a>, use a couple of French words (<em>monsieur</em> and <em>sang</em>) that are thought to have &ldquo;considerable discriminative power for these genres.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> When we call the two functions above on our <code>plays</code> list, we get: <code>document term matrix with |D| = 37 documents and |V| = 15733 words.</code></p>
<p>With all of this in a numpy array, it&rsquo;s simple enough to look up a word in the matrix, find it&rsquo;s index, and then see how all of the plays/genres use that word. What if we used the English &ldquo;blood&rdquo; and &ldquo;love&rdquo; to map out all of the plays/genres? We&rsquo;d get something like the following:</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/imgforblogposts/post_9/Figure_1.png" alt="blood and love in Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s plays"></p>
<p>We could substitute any other word we like and then see how &ldquo;close&rdquo; together the plays are when focusing on the two words of our choosing—here&rsquo;s &ldquo;love&rdquo; and &ldquo;hate&rdquo; on the X and Y axis respectively (the <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/humanities_data_analysis">repo</a> for all of this also has functions that will allow one to use different <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/02/4-types-of-distance-metrics-in-machine-learning/">&ldquo;distance metrics&rdquo;</a> with which to define and quantify the &ldquo;closeness&rdquo; or &ldquo;similarity&rsquo; between any two plays or between different genres&rdquo;):</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/imgforblogposts/post_9/Figure_2.png" alt="love and hate"></p>
<p>We could also wonder a bit about how the genres themselves get arranged—simple enough:</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/imgforblogposts/post_9/Figure_3.png" alt="genre distances based on frequency of &amp;ldquo;love&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;hate&amp;rdquo;"></p>
<p>I suppose what I&rsquo;ve found most useful here is not so much any profound insights into the bard&rsquo;s works (it&rsquo;s great to find other (computation/visual/digital) ways into his texts—and often for me that can function as a nice result in and of itself, but, instead, this &ldquo;computational&rdquo; way of thinking about things that is no doubt still really new and foreign to my strictly humanities-oriented background and training. It&rsquo;s incredibly simple, but learning how to get all of these plays into a nice, structured format that one can then write a couple of rather simple functions to then produce visualizations of the data that are another avenue into the original texts is really fantastic. Not to mention the fact that one could then take these very simple functions/calculations and utilize them in different situations—say, for example, using them in a machine learning algorithm for authorship attribution or in larger projects within the realm of stylometry, etc.—has made all this new knowledge and all these new skills incredibly generative. (With regards to Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;late romances&rdquo;—my mentor in graduate school just called them tragicomedies—I could imagine grabbing a bunch of texts by playwrights that would follow in the wake of Shakespeare: I have only recently come across the <a href="https://earlyprint.org/">&ldquo;EarlyPrint&rdquo;</a> website, which I know has a number of plays by Beaumont and Fletcher. It would be curious to see how close or far away those texts are from some of the plays within the &ldquo;late romances&rdquo; list above &hellip; )</p>
<p>As usual, more to come, for sure.</p>

All the code for the following is available in this <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/twitter_classification_codecademy_project">repo</a>. I then took all this dabbling and turned the algorithms on some different datasets of a much more &ldquo;literary&rdquo; kind. (Another post is still to come on seeing how well the algorithms might be able to distinguish between Willa Cather and one of her key predecessors, Sarah Orne Jewett.)</p>
<p>So, first things first, we&rsquo;re importing the necessary libraries for this task:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After reading in all the Twitter data from a .json file, we needed to think a little bit about how exactly we might want to define a &ldquo;viral tweet&rdquo;? Base it solely on the number of retweets, on the number of likes, on the number of favorites? The parameters for the original task suggested we might start with the median number of retweets for each tweet (I also had a look at the <code>favorite_count</code> as well to see what the minimum, maximum, median, and mean numbers looked like):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>retweet_counts <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> viral_tweets[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;retweet_count&#39;</span>]

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Graphing these values we get the following: <img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_8/Figure_1_summary_statistics.png" alt="Mean and Median Values">
The first time around here I just went with the median value as the cutoff for a &ldquo;viral tweet,&rdquo; so any row in the pandas dataframe that had more than the median number in a row, a new <code>is_viral</code> column got created and the row coded with <code>1</code> if it met the threshold and a <code>0</code> otherwise:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>viral_tweets[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;is_viral&#39;</span>] <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> viral_tweets[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;retweet_count&#39;</span>]<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>apply(<span style="color:#66d9ef">lambda</span> x: <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> x <span style="color:#f92672">&gt;</span> median_retweet_count <span style="color:#66d9ef">else</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next we started having a look at some of the other columns to see which ones might be helpful in predicting if a tweet would meet the median value threshold. Taking a look at the <code>tweet_length</code>, along with the numbers of followers and friends that a Twitter user had, we grabbed this data:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>viral_tweets[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;tweet_length&#39;</span>] <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> viral_tweets<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>apply(<span style="color:#66d9ef">lambda</span> x: len(x[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;text&#39;</span>]), axis<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>)

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next we separated out the <code>is_viral</code> as that will contain the label of each tweet (<code>1</code> for viral, otherwise <code>0</code>). Next we dropped all the columns from the dataframe that we weren&rsquo;t planning on using and just keeping the following list of columns: <code>['tweet_length', 'followers_count', 'friends_count']</code>. We scaled the data, getting us ready to start separating out the training and testing data and then training and fitting the classifier/model to the training data.</p>
<p>As per usual, we used the <code>train_test_split</code> function from <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html">sklearn&rsquo;s</a> library:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>train_data, test_data, train_labels, test_labels <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> train_test_split(scaled_df, labels, test_size <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0.2</span>, random_state <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>)

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(classifier<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>score(test_data, test_labels))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next we wrote a short little loop to keep track of the classifier&rsquo;s scores on the testing data using a different number of &ldquo;clusters&rdquo; (neighbors) ranging from <code>1</code> all the way up to <code>200</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>scores <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> []

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>along with a graph:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_8/Figure_2_first_run_of_scores_01.png" alt="First Run of Accuracy Scores Graph"></p>
<p>So we can see the roughly effectiveness of the classifier&rsquo;s ability to detect a viral tweet (based only on the data in the <code>'tweet_length', 'followers_count',</code> and <code>'friends_count'</code> columns) hovering around 60% or so. There&rsquo;s a steady drop off once the numbers of clusters gets to around 75.</p>
<p>The project then wondered if there were other features within the dataset that we could use to increase the model&rsquo;s predictive effectiveness. For this next round I added the <code>'number_of_hashtags'</code> to see what results that might produce. We then added that column and retrained the classifier:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>hashtag_col_added <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> [<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;tweet_length&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;followers_count&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;friends_count&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;number_of_hashtags&#39;</span>]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>hashtag_df <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> viral_tweets[hashtag_col_added]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>scaled_hashtag_df <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> scale(hashtag_df, axis<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>h_train_data, h_test_data, h_train_labels, h_test_labels <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> train_test_split(scaled_hashtag_df, labels, test_size<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0.2</span>, random_state<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>classifier<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>fit(h_train_data, h_train_labels)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(classifier<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>score(h_test_data, h_test_labels))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Scores taking the hashtags into account were as follows:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_8/hashtag_added.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A model with the <code>'tweet_length_alone'</code>:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_8/tweet_length_alone.png" alt="Tweet Length Alone"></p>
<p>It was intriguing to continue to add features to the classifier to see what the results would be—it was easy enough to thus train multiple models (with different numbers of features) and graph their effectiveness. I tried models where we added <code>'favorite_count'</code>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_8/tweet_length_friends_count_favorite_count.png" alt="Multiple Models"></p>
<p>Curiously, the model with the most features in it performed far less well than the ones with fewer:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_8/four_models.png" alt="Four Models"></p>
<p>One of the suggestions in the project asked one to wonder a bit about the threshold we used to define a &ldquo;viral tweet.&rdquo; We started with the median for the number of retweets a tweet in the dataset received. That number, 13, what if we tinkered a bit with that number? The mean for the <code>'retweet_count'</code> was much higher. Would the classifier before any better if we set the threshold at the mean? Easy enough to have a look-see. Rerunning the script with the mean as the threshold, again splitting the dataset, training the models, and then plotting some scores, we get a considerable increase in accuracy: <img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_8/four_models_with_mean_as_threshold.png" alt="Using the Mean as the &amp;ldquo;Viral Tweet&amp;rdquo; Threshold"> All of these models—with varying numbers of features used—performed much better; all four of them level-out right around 86% accuracy, with the model utilizing &ldquo;tweet_length, # of followers, # of friends, and # of hashtags&rdquo; performing best amongst the four.</p>
<p>Super-fun stuff—to be sure.</p>

Thinking it might be fun to dabble a little bit in some very basic sentiment analysis, I was curious to see what the main Twitter accounts for these five Chicagoland &ldquo;peer institution&rdquo; universities might look like—thus, I wrangled some data (using the <a href="https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape">snscrape</a> library) to see what there was to see. Would one be correct to assume that Twitter accounts for these universities would slide largely in the &ldquo;positive&rdquo; sentiment direction?</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s start with <a href="https://twitter.com/uofstfrancis">USF</a>:</p>
<figure><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_7/usf_sentiment_results_pie_chart.png" width="425" height="auto"/>
</figure>

<p>Running all of the university&rsquo;s tweets through the <a href="https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/quickstart.html">TextBlob</a> python library, it shows the USF Twitter account to be pretty positive. Results for the rest of the schools is pretty similar:</p>

</figure>

<figure><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_7/sx_sentiment_results_pie_chart.png" width="425" height="auto"/>
</figure>

<p>And what about some visuals of sentiment over time? Here&rsquo;s an image of TextBlob&rsquo;s analysis of the &ldquo;polarity&rdquo; and &ldquo;subjectivity&rdquo; scores for each and every USF tweet, ever:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_7/usf_sentiment_scores_all_time.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There is quite a bit of data here one could dig into a bit more deeply. What do like and retweet counts look like for some of the school accounts (and how about coding the graphs with the school colors?)—especially over the lifespan of the account? Here&rsquo;s one for Lewis:</p>
<figure><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_7/lewisu_like_retweet_over_time.png" width="800" height="auto"/>

<p>What about using the <a href="https://bokeh.org/">Bokeh library</a> to add some little &ldquo;hovertools&rdquo; that would link each point on the graph to each individual tweet?</p>

As Department Chair, a good deal of the Assessment Reports each year fall to me. Historically, for the past couple of years I have been more than content to simply just keep all of the scores on our assessed outcomes in one gigantic Excel spreadsheet. This thing certainly kept and held all the numerical data, but it was a bit of a monstrosity—and as the years went by and all the different kinds of courses and kinds of products our students produced to meet all these outcomes increased and multiplied, it became a little unwieldy.</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_6/excel_worksheet_clutter.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The file expanded and expanded with all of these tabs, all these extra worksheets, where I tried to keep track of all of these different kinds of things. There is no doubt whatsoever that all of it makes perfect sense to me—I thought I had some sense of where everything was, which cells linked to which other cells on other sheets, so on and so forth. But as time went on I think a lot of these connections became a little frayed to me and I started to wonder if the web here was all that legible. And then the thought of whether or not all these sheets would be legible to someone other than me was icing on the cake. (I kept thinking of those passages from Henri Bergson&rsquo;s <a href="https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Bergson/Bergson_1911a/Bergson_1911_03.html"><em>Creative Evolution</em></a> where he goes at the age-old philosophical distinction between &ldquo;order&rdquo; and &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; by thinking about the moment when one enters my incredibly &ldquo;messy room&rdquo; and declares it disordered. For me, there&rsquo;s nothing &ldquo;disordered&rdquo; about the room; everything makes perfect sense to me, the clothes are where they are because I threw them there, the bookshelves are stacked three levels deep for all kinds of good reasons—and besides, I know exactly where the Nietzsche section is, I&rsquo;m good with Kierkegaard, and goodness knows I&rsquo;d never forget where the Freud and Lacan are in all this &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; and chaos.)</p>
<p>And then, after doing a bunch of work making my way through Codecademy&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-analyst">data analytics path</a>, I came across Jean-Nicholas Hould&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.jeannicholashould.com/tidy-data-in-python.html">&ldquo;Tidy Data in Python&rdquo;</a> post from a number of years ago now and it was quite a Eureka! moment for me, in so many ways. Again, granted, a Eureka! moment for a total data science neophyte was nothing short of an absolutely inchoate banality for the expert, but none of this lessens the power all this new learning has had for me as of late. Yup, my departmental numbers were in an incredibly &ldquo;messy dataset&rdquo; as <a href="https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf">Hadley Wickham</a> and Hould describe it. So, as the deadline for annual departmental assessment reports rolled around I spent some time tidying up this rather messy dataset. I moved things around with newly-acquired data wrangling skills and got things into a form and structure that followed Wickham&rsquo;s suggestions—as Hould writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Each variable forms a column and contains values</li>
<li>Each observation forms a row</li>
<li>Each type of observational unit forms a table</li>
</ul>

<p>Six years of data—all in one simple CSV file—no more jumping between worksheets in one big file, no more leaping from sheet to sheet to generate graphs or to calculate even the most basic of summary statistics. Again, very far from high-powered machine learning models, K-means clustering, and all of that—just simple data tidying that even the most rudimentary knowledge of the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas library</a> in Python can start to work on quite nicely, quickly, and simply. Nothing fancy, just a nice clean .csv file:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_6/simple_csv_file.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With all that in place it was just a simple hop, skip, and a jump to some simple visualizations of the data:</p>

<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_6/Figure_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_6/Figure_3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Again, nothing fancy, but just a whole lot easier to work with everything when it&rsquo;s nice and &ldquo;tidy.&rdquo; Working with and querying the data became so much simpler—a line of code here and there and I could get information about averages—both current and historical—, information on student performance based on instructor, performance on individual outcomes, and so much more. And all because the data was cleaned up. Not to mention that with the structure in place going forward adding to the dataset becomes even simpler as well.</p>
<p>The repo with simple scripts for all this dummy data along with the visualizations is <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/solo_projects/tree/main/blog_post_projects/departmental_reports">here</a>.</p>

One of his posts from earlier this year, <a href="https://jonreeve.com/2021/05/rethinking-mla-papers/">&ldquo;Rethinking the MLA Style Research Paper&rdquo;</a> was incredibly generative for me—and it nicely dovetailed with some work my Departmental colleagues have been doing on thinking about writing at our university (a project generously funded by the <a href="https://www.avdf.org/">Arthur Vining Davis Foundation</a>). In addition, I&rsquo;ve been spending a good deal of time with Scott Selisker&rsquo;s wonderful <a href="http://u.arizona.edu/~selisker/post/workflow/">post</a> about the use of plain text writing in academic workflows—I&rsquo;ve learned how to incorporate <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> and even used Selisker&rsquo;s workflow suggestions to compose my department&rsquo;s assessment report from last year. I think it&rsquo;s just a tad bit frightening to think about how I did things before all this new knowledge. There is an enormous power to working either with plain text or writing everything in <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a> and then converting said text into all kinds of different formats via Pandoc. This is not even to mention the ways in which this workflow makes it incredibly easy to incorporate code into the writing—which, of course, prior to very recently, I never had anything to do with—now I feel as if I&rsquo;ve got a vast new area of knowledge to explore and discover. Terribly exciting and exhilarating.</p>
<p>Here in this post what I&rsquo;m hoping to do—admittedly incredibly modest—is combine Reeve&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/JonathanReeve/template-research-paper">repository</a> for the aforementioned &ldquo;Rethinking&rdquo; post along with utilizing the .css from <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">Dave Liepmann</a>, which attempts to fashion a style derived from the work of <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi">Edward Tufte</a>, especially the really fantastic stuff found in his <em>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em>. We&rsquo;ll see how it goes!</p>
<p>I should also mention a couple of the other places that were helpful:</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Sustainable Authorship in Plain Text using Pandoc and Markdown&rdquo; by Dennis Tenen and Grant Wythoff over at the <a href="https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown">Programming Historian</a> was a really nice start for me. I haven&rsquo;t gotten a chance to go through Tenen&rsquo;s <em>Plain Text: The Poetics of Composition</em> yet, but I am looking forward to that.</li>
<li>Mort Yao&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.soimort.org/notes/161117/">&ldquo;Boilerplating Pandoc for Academic Writing&rdquo;</a> was also very  useful as I was futzing around with using Pandoc to convert my assessment report from Markdown into .pdf format.</li>

<p>So, this last semester I did another &ldquo;Introduction to Literature&rdquo; course (as I so often do)—this time around I decided to set the theme around that of &ldquo;weird fiction.&rdquo; Since the <a href="https://dhsouthbend.org/dhri/">South Bend DHRI</a> last May I have been thinking a great deal about this whole &ldquo;data visualization&rdquo; thing. I wanted to find some way to visually represent the stories in the anthology that students were gravitating to from week to week. I gave minimal guidance—some weeks I would point out that one of my favorite stories was up on the docket or I tried to link the week&rsquo;s discussion to concerns or interests that students had shown in previous weeks. (This was just the old &ldquo;If you liked Julio Cortazar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Axolotl,&rdquo; be sure to read <em>X</em> &hellip;&rdquo;) There had to be an easy way to represent visually all the student interactions.</p>
<p>Not being an expert, I had to stumble around stupidly and idiotically. Starting with something as silly as a Venn Diagram drawn up in Microsoft Word—hoping to keep track of the kinds of connections students were making to the readings:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_4/figure_2_week_1_discussion_board_venn_diagram.png" alt=""></p>
<p>1st Iteration: just trying to draw the discussion board that week (I have whited-out student names)</p>
<p>Of course, I was first just trying to figure out how to simply draw the connections and not worry so much about the <em>how</em> or the kind of connections being made:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_4/figure_3_week_2_posts_by_story.png" alt=""></p>
<p>2nd Iteration: now simply logging the number of posts about each particular story</p>
<p>Heck—I could draw it by hand, but I wanted to be able to do it not just each week but also be able to produce a graph that would visualize the entire sixteen-week seminar.</p>
<p>And then I came across a tool (IIRC, I found a couple of tutorials on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk_jmmkw5S2BqnYBqF2VNPcszY93-ze49">jengolbeck</a>), a tool called <a href="https://gephi.org/"><em>Gephi</em></a> that would allow me to do exactly what I wanted—and quite a bit more, actually. I could take all of the students, myself, and all the texts that we would read, get them into a simple .csv file and then each week I could manually code the connections each individual student was making to the possible texts up for discussion (and also log the times students responded to me or to each other).</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_4/figure_4_gephi.png" alt="">
<img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_4/figure_5_gephi.png" alt="">
<img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_4/figure_6_gephi.png" alt="">
<img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_4/figure_7_gephi.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These are just some of the visualizations I played with over the course of the semester (all the green dots are students, the blue dot is me, and all the red ones are stories we read and that students discussed; the size of the nodes are determined by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(graph_theory)">&ldquo;degree&rdquo;</a> of the node). The big red node in the graph in the upper left was the most talked about story out of the entire anthology, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonora_Carrington">Leonora Carrington</a>&rsquo;s 1941 absurdist little tale, &ldquo;White Rabbits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tool also gives one some rather basic graph theory and simple statistical information as well. It is easy to have the computer count up the connections, making it rather simple to figure out the most popular texts over the course of the seminar:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_4/figure_10_most_popular.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It was also really simple to see which stories students did not talk about at all (the group in the upper right are all the texts no one mentioned):</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_4/figure_9_gephi.png" alt="A Final Graph"></p>
<p>Obviously, there are all kinds of ways to make this data slightly &ldquo;richer.&rdquo; After a week or two I noticed that I did want to get back to the &ldquo;kinds&rdquo; of connections students were making to the texts. Thus, Gephi makes it easy to &ldquo;weight&rdquo; the connections, so I started cataloging <em>how</em> students were interacting: if they cited lines directly from the story, the line was weighted as a 2; if they were strongly referring to the story only through paraphrase, it got a 1.5; no citation whatsoever got a 1. This would then make it easier for me to see how often students were doing something as basic as directly citing the story under discussion in their posts.</p>
<p>It would be cool—I&rsquo;m not sure at all if there is a way to do this from within Gephi—if one could time lapse this whole thing so one could watch the connections get drawn over the course of the semester. One can—and I did—keep track of which connections got made each week (that&rsquo;s as simple as adding another column in the .csv): I had originally wanted to see if I could track the size of my own node over time: my plan was to be a really frequent participant in the first few weeks of the semester. It&rsquo;s easy to show in the graph how those first few weeks of the semester saw me responding to every single student post. I had hoped that my node would become slightly smaller and smaller as the semester went on. By and large, that was true.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that I will continue to fiddle around with all over this the next time I teach this course (which will be in the Spring here after the start of the new year). What kinds of things will I see popping up when I do all this a second time? Will I see a similarity in terms of popularity of texts over the semester? Will I see that similar phenomenon where we have a somewhat small(ish) group of students who are really &ldquo;talkative&rdquo; as we usually do in our f2f classrooms (while the larger group is slightly more reserved)? I have no clue—I&rsquo;m curious to see. (I spent a little bit of time, not much, dabbling with tools/libraries in Python that would do something similar—I know there is <a href="https://igraph.org/python/">iGraph</a> and there no doubt have to be others that I don&rsquo;t even know about. Another slightly more &ldquo;technical&rdquo; rather than philosophical question would be whether or not I would want to figure out a way to automate all of this rather than coding it by hand, so to speak. I know that spaCy has some really powerful tools that one could use to do this: create a custom NER [Named Entity Recognition] with the names of the texts, students, etc., write a script to have the computer find which students are looking at which stories, and then to have it draw the network graph. It would also be somewhat simple enough to think of a way to script the whole process that would also allow you to set some criterion for the whole &ldquo;weighting&rdquo; of the edges, too, though that would need to be a little bit more sophisticated.)</p>
<p>More to come, as always &hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_3/figure_1_stoker_word_cloud.png" alt="Fig. 1: Word Cloud for Bram Stoker&amp;rsquo;s Dracula"></p>
<p>This past July I got an opportunity to do a NEH Summer Seminar over at the University of Iowa (&quot;<a href="https://religion-secularism-novel.sites.uiowa.edu/">Religion, Secularism, and the Novel</a>&quot;), where the group read a number of canonical novels (<em>Crusoe</em>, <em>Silas Marner</em>, <em>Dracula</em>, <em>On the Road</em>, and <em>Home</em>). I enjoyed the seminar and loved all the so-called traditional humanities stuff: deep discussion, attentiveness to rhetoric and form, and all the other things that we literary scholars do so well. I did also fidget around with some of the newer DH methods (at the time it was really just basic computational stuff: counting tokens, plotting frequency dispersions, making silly little Word Clouds, etc.) on those very same texts we were looking at (excluding Robinson&rsquo;s <em>Home</em>).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.nltk.org/book_1ed/ch01.html">&ldquo;lexical dispersion plot&rdquo;</a> for the word &ldquo;time&rdquo; in Stoker&rsquo;s <em>Dracula</em>:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_3/figure_2_time_in_stoker.png" alt="Time"></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a dispersion plot for some of the major characters in <em>Dracula</em>:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_3/figure_3_character_dispersion_plots.png" alt="Character Dispersion Plots"></p>
<p>Here are some common nouns in <em>Dracula</em>:</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_3/figure_4_common_word_counts.png" alt="Common Nouns"></p>
<p>Another Dispersion Plot</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really find anything too profound—although it did for some reason surprise me just slightly that a word like &ldquo;time&rdquo; occurred as frequently as it did in <em>Dracula</em> (simple counts found it 373 times [full exploratory notebook for this is available <a href="https://github.com/kspicer80/nehsummerseminar2019playground/blob/master/nehexploratorynotebook.ipynb">here</a>—the dispersion plots too at this moment in time aren&rsquo;t actually plotting in Jupyter Notebooks {the <a href="https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/397">issue</a>, it seems, is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54264548/nltk-lexical-dispersion-plot-does-not-show-on-google-colab">known</a> as of 24 December 2019}]).</p>
<p>I also spent a little bit of time messing around with <a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a>—tinkering around with the &ldquo;Part of Speech&rdquo; (POS) tagger and other things on the four texts. Here are some counts of different parts of speech in the four novels:</p>

<p>Dean, in <em>On the Road</em>, always trying to live in the eternal now, makes total sense the verb &ldquo;to be&rdquo; would show up all around him.</p>
<p><img src="/images/imgforblogposts/post_3/figure_6_kerouac_gender.png" alt="Dean Verbs"></p>
<p>The code to generate the above figure is available <a href="https://gist.github.com/kspicer80/f78d0cfccc43a9e07b05efca6b652b96">here</a>)</p>
<p>One of the day&rsquo;s questions about <em>On the Road</em> at the NEH Seminar had to do with what exactly it is like to read a book like <em>On the Road</em> after the #MeToo movement. Some quick counting of the verbs used to describe Marylou, for instance, comes up as follows:</p>

I am just beginning to dip my toes into water that others are already expert swimmers in—and have been for many many years. </p>
<p>I am not sure either if the kinds of things these digital or computational tools can do will be all they helpful to me in the long run.  The literature is rife with the central question that no doubt is preeminent for most scholars in the humanities, especially those of us who cut our teeth on &ldquo;close reading.&rdquo;  At the same time, learning about some of these new tools would seem to be fine give my recent (as of around July or August of last year) turn to a much more Deleuzian—rather than Derridean—philosophical posture and style of thinking.  Why not use these tools to proliferate new and bizarre ways of thinking about what it is humanities scholars do?  Why not take Nabokov&rsquo;s <em>Lolita</em> and feed it through a bunch of algorithms designed for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">sentiment analysis</a>? (Actually, I&rsquo;m in the process of doing just that and it strikes me that Nabokov&rsquo;s novel would seem to be one of those that should be a nice testing ground for all kinds of work in DH [and it could be already for all I know; as I say, I&rsquo;m just barely getting a sense for what&rsquo;s been done in the field so far, it&rsquo;s all totally brand new to me).  Even from the very first line of that novel Nabokov is playing with the very stuff of language—carving up into phonemes the name of the eponymous love interest of Humbert Humbert.  I also noticed, just flipping through my copy recently, of what a morass <em>Lolita</em> could be for someone first training their (or their algorithm&rsquo;s sights on it):  the constant switch from English to French, the never-ending insertions of French phrases and names and dialogue, and—just staying within the language of English:   Nabokov&rsquo;s constant attention to and awareness of the phonetic stuff of language, e.g. take this from Part One:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; I kept repeating this automatic stuff and holding her under its special spell (spell because of the garbling), and all the while I was mortally afraid that some act of God might interrupt me, might remove the golden load in the sensation of which all my being seemed concentrated, and this anxiety forced me to work, for the first minute or so, more hastily than was consensual with deliberately modulated enjoyment.  <em>The stars that sparkled, and the cars that parkled, and the bars, and the barmen were presently taken over by her &hellip;</em> (<em>The Annotated Lolita</em>, ed. Alfred Appel, Jr. [New York:  McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1970], p. 61)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We all know what a distinguished polymath Nabokov was—and I wonder what DH methods of textual analysis and text mining such a text would be amenable to &hellip; As I say, I&rsquo;ll get a cleaned-up version of the text ready and give it a go.  (I should also probably give a shout out to David H— whose essay on Humbert&rsquo;s aestheticism had been bouncing around in my head all week while over at Notre Dame; not sure why that was &hellip;)  Why do I always feel this urge to never close a parenthesis like this—or at the very least to keep proliferating it indefinitely &hellip;?)  What would a sentiment analysis algorithm do with all of H.P. Lovecraft&rsquo;s fiction?  Anything useful? (I&rsquo;ll get on this one too and report back &hellip;)  </p>
<p>As I say, it&rsquo;s possible all these new tools are totally unhelpful, although I suspect that&rsquo;s not going to end up being the case.  Just one example to suffice for now.  The South Bend DHRI sent along some reading materials to all the participants ahead of the institute.  One little remark in Dennis Tenen&rsquo;s article in <em>Debates in the Digital Humanities</em>, <a href="http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/60">&ldquo;Blunt Instrumentalism: On Tools and Methods&rdquo;</a> mentions the k-means clustering method in topic modeling as an algorithm that is non-deterministic, which means that it &ldquo;will perform differently each time it is run &hellip;&rdquo;  Last academic year while working on the English Department&rsquo;s Program Review I spent a great of time thinking about what it our faculty mean when they talk about &ldquo;close reading.&rdquo;  I found myself returning again and again to talking about the ontology and philosophy of events, as that word is used (very differently) by Derrida and Deleuze. I found myself again and again running into this paradoxical situation where we describe the coming together of reader, text, and this third thing, the &ldquo;event of reading,&rdquo; which is absolutely singular and never to be repeated; simultaneously, this &ldquo;event of reading&rdquo; must be iterable, to use Derrida&rsquo;s language.  I think this idiom of non-deterministic algorithmic behavior could be helpful in giving me another way to describe what it is that we do when we closely read something.  We do something algorithmic—we do not read arbitrarily, simply following our own whims and caprices—; there is a method to our madness, but it is not a deterministic one.</p>
<p>(Rereading some parts of Rita Felski&rsquo;s <em>The Limits of Critique</em> for the <a href="https://religion-secularism-novel.sites.uiowa.edu/">NEH Summer Seminar</a> I&rsquo;ll be attending here very soon, I came across the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One indispensable link in this chain of mediators is a reader whose response is never entirely predictable or knowable.  It is here that literary studies need to steer clear of a vulgar sociology (where a reader is reduced to the sum of her demographical data) as well as of a one-dimensional theory of language (where a reader is a nodal point through which language or discourse flows). Readers are not autonomous, self-contained, centers of meaning, but they are also not mere flotsam and jetsam tossed on the tides of social or linguistic forces that they are helpless to affect or comprehend. When they encounter texts, they do so in all their commonality and quirkiness; they mediate and in turn are mediated, in both predictable and perplexing ways. (<em>The Limits of Critique</em> [Chicago:  U of Chicago P, 2015], p. 171.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very nicely put—I dig it.)</p>

<p>The whole &ldquo;close vs. distant&rdquo; reading issue is no doubt just about gatekeeping, as Ted Underwood has <a href="http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/95">argued</a>, and is one of those things where my (re)turn to Deleuze is helpful:  a logic of opposition should not be chosen over a language of difference—distant reading is perhaps just simply a different way of reading and not necessarily opposed to reading closely. An unsupervised (or supervised) nondeterministic algorithm is what we do when we humans read closely?  Why not?</p>

<p>So after a week-long <a href="http://dhsouthbend.org/dhri/">research institute</a> put together by some fantastic people at the College of St. Mary&rsquo;s and Notre Dame earlier in the summer, I got my hands dirty with a whole host of tools of the trade within the Digital Humanities.  As one can see from the <a href="http://dhsouthbend.org/dhri/curriculum/">curriculum</a>, the week was rather intense and both I and <a href="https://annaioanes.wordpress.com/">my colleague</a> came back exhausted, to be sure, but also full of all kinds of new knowledge and (best of all) a sense of how much knowledge we still need to try to acquire.</p>
<p>Playing around with <a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a>-displaCy and a sentence from Beverly Cleary&rsquo;s <em>Ramona Forever</em> (image shows a &ldquo;dependency parsing&rdquo; for the novel&rsquo;s first sentence—my youngest child is reading all of these books at the moment):</p>
