<p>So after a week-long <a href="http://dhsouthbend.org/dhri/">research institute</a> put together by some fantastic people at the College of St. Mary&rsquo;s and Notre Dame earlier in the summer, I got my hands dirty with a whole host of tools of the trade within the Digital Humanities.  As one can see from the <a href="http://dhsouthbend.org/dhri/curriculum/">curriculum</a>, the week was rather intense and both I and <a href="https://annaioanes.wordpress.com/">my colleague</a> came back exhausted, to be sure, but also full of all kinds of new knowledge and (best of all) a sense of how much knowledge we still need to try to acquire.</p>
<p>Playing around with <a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a>-displaCy and a sentence from Beverly Cleary&rsquo;s <em>Ramona Forever</em> (image shows a &ldquo;dependency parsing&rdquo; for the novel&rsquo;s first sentence—my youngest child is reading all of these books at the moment):</p>

<p>Feel free to go and compare the nicer (less black-and-white version) provided by Google&rsquo;s Cloud Natural Language API <a href="https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/">here</a>. </p>
<p>More to come &hellip; (I&rsquo;m also hoping to use this whole site as a kind of sandbox in which to play around with many of these new toys, not to mention just Wordpress itself &hellip; [I need a bunch more time playing around with this new &ldquo;block&rdquo; editor thing here too[updated as of 12.24.2021: I need more time to fiddle around with Markdown, HTML, and a bunch of other stuff]]—nobody&rsquo;ll read these things anyways, so here seems as good a place as any, lol &hellip;)</p>
<p>The simple code to generate the displaCy figure is here:</p>
